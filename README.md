#### How to use this repository?

Users can download a zip file of the entire repository by clicking on the green code tab at the top of the page and then clicking Download ZIP. Users who already have a GitHub account can fork the repository.

The key file in this repository is the 📄 ms.qmd. This file can be rendered in R with Quarto to reproduce the entire paper. Code chunks within the file provide the code used to reproduce figures and analyses along with supporting statements within the text. Note that inline code chunks use specific objects which are then rendered.

The 📄 ms.qmd file makes use of files within a number of folders that are identified in the code chunks. There are a number of important folders in the repository.

  📂 data folder contains all the raw data used in files. Note that there are different files, but the main one employed in our analyses is Learning.csv. In Lizards_associative_learning.xlsx there are different sheets with the original data, a small legend with the meaning of each variable, and some information about the subjects and the results from the habituation/training stage. 
  📂 output/figs/ Folder contains all the figures for the paper that are read and included in the paper. 
  📂 R The R folder contains three files, two of them used to clean and process data to prepare it for use in the ms.qmd file. Note that readers do not need to open and run these files, but they are simply here to document the workflow and code used to clean up data to be used. These include:
        📄 1_data_process.R, which is used to clean the data/Learning.csv file. The result of the cleaning is shown in ./output/databases_clean/data_clean.csv;
        📄 func.R, which contains all the functions called later in the ms.qmd file. 
  📂 bib The bib folder contains:
        📄 refs.bib the references;
        📄 behavioral-ecology.csl the journal formatting style file;
        📄 template.docx a template docx file to format the resulting rendered files.
