#### Research paper

This repository contains the final code, data, and figures used in the following manuscript:

Recio et al. 2024. 

Supplementary Materials: The supplementary materials associated with this paper is integrated within the ms.docx or ms.qmd files. 

#### How to use this repository?

Users can download a zip file of the entire repository by clicking on the green code tab at the top of the page and then clicking Download ZIP. Users who already have a GitHub account can fork the repository.

The key file in this repository is the ðŸ“„ ms.qmd. This file can be rendered in R with Quarto to reproduce the entire paper. Code chunks within the file provide the code used to reproduce figures and analyses along with supporting statements within the text. Note that inline code chunks use specific objects which are then rendered.

The ðŸ“„ ms.qmd file makes use of files within a number of folders that are identified in the code chunks. There are a number of important folders in the repository.

  ðŸ“‚ data folder contains all the raw data used in files. Note that there are different files, but the main one employed in our analyses is Learning.csv. In 
  ðŸ“‚ output/figs/ Folder contains all the figures for the paper that are read and included in the paper. See more details below (3. Figures).
  ðŸ“‚ R The R folder contains three files that are used to clean and process data to prepare it for use in the ðŸ“„ ms.qmd file. Note that readers do not need to open and run these files, but they are simply here to document the workflow and code used to clean up data to be used. These include:
        ðŸ“„ 1_data_processing.R, which is used to first download the Google Sheets used during our hackathon, process and merge with meta-data from the California Digital Library (CDL);
        ðŸ“„ 2_data_cleaning.R File does some additional cleaning and checking of the data and merges disparate datasets together.
        ðŸ“„ 3_author_affli.R, which is code to grab and process author affiliations because the lead author is a little lazy when it comes to cumbersome tasks such as these.
    ðŸ“‚ bib The bib folder contains:
        ðŸ“„ refs.bib the references;
        ðŸ“„ proceedings-of-the-royal-society-b.csl the journal formatting style file;
        ðŸ“„ template.docx a template docx file to format the resulting rendered files.

3. Figures

ðŸ“„ ms.qmd will rely on figures generated and stored in the ðŸ“‚ output/figs/ folder. The final list of figures are as follows:

    ðŸ“„ Figure 1_FINAL.png
    ðŸ“„ Figure 2_FINAL.png

Note that these figures are a composite of figures patched together and the final files were modified outside of R for aesthetic reasons. These files also have associated Adobe illustrator files. The code to reproduce individual figures is provided in ðŸ“„ ms.qmd. When rendered individual files will be written to the ðŸ“‚ output/figs/ folder.
4. Data

Given the project has been a major group effort we initially relied on Google Sheets to provide pathways by which all authors could contribute to the data collection process. These Google Sheets were then sourced, processed, checked and then cleaned prior to analysis. The first initial file was provided to us by the California Digital Library (CDL) team, who downloaded the relevant meta-data on the articles posted to EcoEvoRxiv as of 30 September 2023.

The original meta-data files from the CDL are located in the ðŸ“‚ data folder, but the main one used is:

    ðŸ“„ 20231003_EER_preprints_metadata.xlsx
