@article{hope_incubation_2018,
	abstract = {The environment in which animals develop can have important consequences for their phenotype. In reptiles, incubation temperature is a critical aspect of the early developmental environment. Incubation temperature influences morphology, physiology, and behavior of non-avian reptiles, however, little is known about how incubation temperature influences offspring phenotype and behaviors important to avian survival. To investigate whether incubation temperature influences avian behaviors, we collected wood duck (Aix sponsa) eggs from the field and incubated them at three naturally occurring incubation temperatures (35.0, 35.8, and 37.0◦C). We conducted multiple repeated behavioral trials on individual ducklings between 5 and 15 days post-hatch to assess activity, exploratory, and boldness behaviors, classified along a proactive-reactive continuum. We measured growth rates and circulating levels of baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels to investigate possible physiological correlates of behavior. Ducklings incubated at the lowest temperature displayed more proactive behaviors than those incubated at the two higher temperatures. We also found that younger ducklings exhibited more proactive behavior than older ducklings and males exhibited more proactive behavior than females. Further, duckling behaviors were repeatable across time and contexts, indicative of a proactive--reactive continuum of behavioral tendencies. However, neither corticosterone levels nor growth rates were related to behavior. This provides some of the first evidence that incubation temperature, a critical parental effect, influences avian offspring behaviors that may be important for survival. Our results identify incubation temperature as a mechanism that contributes to the development of behavioral traits and, in part, explains how multiple behavioral types may be maintained within populations.},

@article{riley_early_2017,
	abstract = {Early social environment can play a significant role in shaping behavioural development. For instance, in many social mammals and birds, isolation rearing results in individuals that are less exploratory, shyer, less social and more aggressive than individuals raised in groups. Moreover, dynamic aspects of social environments, such as the nature of relationships between individuals, can also impact the trajectory of development. We tested if being raised alone or socially affects behavioural development in the family-living tree skink,
              Egernia striolata
              . Juveniles were raised in two treatments: alone or in a pair. We assayed exploration, boldness, sociability and aggression repeatedly throughout each juvenile's first year of life, and also assessed social interactions between pairs to determine if juveniles formed dominant--subordinate relationships. We found that male and/or the larger skinks within social pairs were dominant. Developing within this social environment reduced skink growth, and subordinate skinks were more prone to tail loss. Thus, living with a conspecific was costly for
              E. striolata
              . The predicted negative effects of isolation failed to materialize. Nevertheless, there were significant differences in behavioural traits depending on the social environment (isolated, dominant or subordinate member of a pair). Isolated skinks were more social than subordinate skinks. Subordinate skinks also became more aggressive over time, whereas isolated and dominant skinks showed invariable aggression. Dominant skinks became bolder over time, whereas isolated and subordinate skinks were relatively stable in their boldness. In summary, our study is evidence that isolation rearing does not consistently affect behaviour across all social taxa. Our study also demonstrates that the social environment plays an important role in behavioural development of a family-living lizard.},

@article{trnik_persistent_2011,
	abstract = {Although variability in behavioral traits within animal populations is well documented, the mechanisms maintaining that variability are still insufficiently known. In this study, we examined whether differences in thermal environment during egg incubation can permanently organize nonsocial behavior across different contexts and situations in a lizard species. We incubated eggs of the Yucatan banded gecko, Coleonyx elegans (Squamata: Gekkota: Eublepharidae) at 3 constant temperatures (26, 28, and 30 $\,^{\circ}$C) and raised juveniles separately under the same conditions until adulthood. We then subjected them to 3 behavioral tests within 2 different contexts: an open-field test and a test of antipredator behavior (stressful context) as well as a test of feeding behavior (nonstressful context). Individuals of both sexes incubated at 30 $\,^{\circ}$C were consistently less active and showed lower frequencies of several stereotypic behaviors in the stressful contexts than did individuals incubated at 26 and 28 $\,^{\circ}$C. The test of feeding behavior revealed no significant effect of incubation temperature on geckos' behavior. Thus, our study demonstrates that developmental plasticity may play an important role in producing variability in stress-induced behavior in lizards.},

@article{deutsch_impacts_2008,
	abstract = {The impact of anthropogenic climate change on terrestrial organisms is often predicted to increase with latitude, in parallel with the rate of warming. Yet the biological impact of rising temperatures also depends on the physiological sensitivity of organisms to temperature change. We integrate empirical fitness curves describing the thermal tolerance of terrestrial insects from around the world with the projected geographic distribution of climate change for the next century to estimate the direct impact of warming on insect fitness across latitude. The results show that warming in the tropics, although relatively small in magnitude, is likely to have the most deleterious consequences because tropical insects are relatively sensitive to temperature change and are currently living very close to their optimal temperature. In contrast, species at higher latitudes have broader thermal tolerance and are living in climates that are currently cooler than their physiological optima, so that warming may even enhance their fitness. Available thermal tolerance data for several vertebrate taxa exhibit similar patterns, suggesting that these results are general for terrestrial ectotherms. Our analyses imply that, in the absence of ameliorating factors such as migration and adaptation, the greatest extinction risks from global warming may be in the tropics, where biological diversity is also greatest.},

@article{hoops_fully_2021,
	abstract = {As the relevance of lizards in evolutionary neuroscience increases, so does the need for more accurate anatomical references. Moreover, the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in evolutionary neuroscience is becoming more widespread; this represents a fundamental methodological shift that opens new avenues of investigative possibility but also poses new challenges. Here, we aim to facilitate this shift by providing a three-dimensional segmentation atlas of the tawny dragon brain. The tawny dragon (Ctenophorus decresii) is an Australian lizard of increasing importance as a model system in ecology and, as a member of the agamid lizards, in evolution. Based on a consensus average 3D image generated from the MRIs of 13 male tawny dragon heads, we identify and segment 224 structures visible across the entire lizard brain. We describe the relevance of this atlas to the field of evolutionary neuroscience and propose further experiments for which this atlas can provide the foundation. This advance in defining lizard neuroanatomy will facilitate numerous studies in evolutionary neuroscience. The atlas is available for download as a supplementary material to this manuscript and through the Open Science Framework (OSF; https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/UJENQ).},

@article{atanasova_prenatal_2009,
	abstract = {Human epidemiological studies have indicated that low birth weight associated with an adverse intrauterine environment is related to a greater incidence of cardiovascular disorders in later life. In the foetus, endogenous glucocorticoids generally increase if there is intrauterine nutrient deficiency. The consequent glucocorticoid hyperexposure has been hypothesised to cause in utero programming of atherogenic genes. We investigated the effect of oral treatment with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone during early or late pregnancy in marmoset monkeys on oxidative and antioxidant status in the offspring. Urinary concentrations of F2-isoprostanes were quantified as markers for in vivo oxidative stress. Expression of the mRNAs for the antioxidant enzymes cytosolic glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1), phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (GPx-4), cytosolic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), mitochondrial Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD2), glutathione reductase (GSR), modifier subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLM) and catalase were determined in the aorta. Three groups of pregnant marmosets (10 animals per group) were treated orally for one week with vehicle, or with dexamethasone (5 mg/kg daily) during two gestation windows: early dexamethasone group, pregnancy day 42 -- 48, and late dexamethasone group, pregnancy day 90-- 96. In one male sibling of each litter (10 males per group), aortas were taken at 2 years of age. In the late dexamethasone group a higher aortic mRNA expression for GPx-1 ( p , 0.023), MnSOD ( p , 0.016), GCLM ( p , 0.019) and GSR ( p , 0.014) in comparison to the controls was observed. Aortic expression in the early dexamethasone group was statistically significantly higher only for GSR mRNA ( p , 0.038). No significant changes in urinary F2-isoprostane concentrations between controls, early and late dexamethasone groups at 2 years of age were observed. Hence, prenatal exposure to dexamethasone in the third trimester leads to increased mRNA expression of several aortic antioxidant enzymes in the offspring. This expression pattern was not temporally related to oxidative stress, and it may reflect in utero re-programming of aortic antioxidant gene expression during prenatal glucocorticoid exposure.},

	abstract = {Brain size relative to body size varies considerably among animals, but the ecological consequences of that variation remain poorly understood. Plausibly, larger brains confer increased behavioural flexibility, and an ability to respond to novel challenges. In keeping with that hypothesis, successful invasive species of birds and mammals that flourish after translocation to a new area tend to have larger brains than do unsuccessful invaders. We found the same pattern in ectothermic terrestrial vertebrates. Brain size relative to body size was larger in species of amphibians and reptiles reported to be successful invaders, compared to species that failed to thrive after translocation to new sites. This pattern was found in six of seven global biogeographic realms; the exception (where relatively larger brains did not facilitate invasion success) was Australasia. Establishment success was also higher in amphibian and reptile families with larger relative brain sizes. Future work could usefully explore whether invasion success is differentially associated with enlargement of specific parts of the brain (as predicted by the functional role of the forebrain in promoting behavioural flexibility), or with a general size increase (suggesting that invasion success is facilitated by enhanced perceptual and motor skills, as well as cognitive ability).},

@article{cassano_glutamatergic_2012,
	abstract = {Deficits in glutamate neurotransmission and mitochondrial functions were detected in the frontal cortex (FC) and hippopcampus (HIPP) of aged 3 XTg-Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice, compared with their wild type littermates (non-Tg). In particular, basal levels of glutamate and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUTl) expression were reduced in both areas. Cortical glutamate release responded to K+ stimulation, whereas no peak release was observed in the HIPP of mutant mice. Synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25), glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST), glutamate transporter 1 (GLTl) and excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAACl) were reduced in HIPPhomogenates, where the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content was lower. In contrast, glutamate transporter 1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were found to be higher in the frontal cortex. The respiration rates of complex-I, II, IV, and the membrane potential were reduced in cortical mitochondria, where unaltered proton leak, FoFi-ATPase activity and ATP content, with increased hydrogen peroxide production (H 20 2), were also observed. In contrast, complex-I respiration rate was significantly increased in hippocampal mitochondria, together with increased proton leak and H2O2 production. Moreover, loss of complex-IV and F0Fi-ATPase activities were observed. These data suggest that impairments of mitochondrial bioenergetics might sustain the failure in the energy-requiring glutamatergic transmission. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of exposure to chronic mild stress (CMS), a paradigm developed in the late 1980s as an animal model of depression, on the mitochondrial function and mitochondrial ultrastructure in the mouse brain. The results showed that the CMS regime induced depressive-like symptoms in mice characterized by reduced sucrose preference and body weight. Moreover, CMS exposure was associated with a significant increase in immobility time in the tail suspension test. Exposure to the CMS paradigm inhibited mitochondrial respiration rates and dissipated mitochondrial membrane potential in hippocampus, cortex and hypothalamus of mice. In addition, we found a damaged mitochondrial ultrastructure in brains of mice exposed to CMS. These findings provide evidence for brain mitochondrial dysfunction and ultrastructural damage in a mouse model of depression. Moreover, these findings suggest that mitochondrial malfunction-induced oxidative injury could play a role in stress-related disorders such as depression.},

              signaling, and generation of reactive oxygen species. Neurons critically depend on mitochondrial function to establish membrane excitability and to execute the complex processes of neurotransmission and plasticity. While much information about mitochondrial properties is available from studies on isolated mitochondria and dissociated cell cultures, less is known about mitochondrial function in intact neurons in brain tissue. However, a detailed description of the interactions between mitochondrial function, energy metabolism, and neuronal activity is crucial for the understanding of the complex physiological behavior of neurons, as well as the pathophysiology of various neurological diseases. The combination of new fluorescence imaging techniques, electrophysiology, and brain slice preparations provides a powerful tool to study mitochondrial function during neuronal activity, with high spatiotemporal resolution. This review summarizes recent findings on mitochondrial Ca

              transport, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ
              m

We will first discuss interactions of these parameters for experimental stimulation conditions that can be related to the physiological range. We will then describe how mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction develops during pathological neuronal activity, focusing on temporal lobe epilepsy and its experimental models. The aim is to illustrate that 1) the structure of the mitochondrial compartment is highly dynamic in neurons, 2) there is a fine-tuned coupling between neuronal activity and mitochondrial function, and 3) mitochondria are of central importance for the complex behavior of neurons.},

	abstract = {Cognitive flexibility helps organisms to respond adaptively to environmental changes. Deficits in this executive function have been associated with a variety of brain disorders, and it has been shown to rely on various concomitant neurobiological mechanisms. However, the involvement of the glutamatergic system in general, and NMDA receptors in particular, has been debated. Therefore, we injected C57BL/6 mice repeatedly with low-doses of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (dizocilpine, 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.). Reversal learning and the use of specific cognitive strategies were assessed in a non-spatial discrimination touchscreen task and the Morris water maze (MWM) spatial learning task. In addition, mice were subjected to a non-mnemonic test battery. Although initial acquisition learning was not affected by MK-801 administration, it did induce deficits in reversal learning, both in the non-spatial and spatial task. Defects in non-spatial reversal learning appeared to be caused by perseverative errors. Also, MK-801 administration induced perseverative behaviours as well as inefficient spatial strategy use during MWM reversal learning. These effects could not be reduced to changes in exploratory (anxiety-related) behaviours, nor to motor deficits. This was consistent with results in the non-mnemonic test battery, during which MK-801 evoked hyperlocomotion and subtle motor defects, but failed to alter general motor activity and exploratory behaviours. In conclusion, NMDA receptors appear to be involved in the flexible cognitive processes that underlie reversal learning in spatial as well as non-spatial tasks. Our results also indicate that reversal learning as well as the use of cognitively demanding strategies are more sensitive to NMDA receptor blockage than some other functions that have been suggested to be NMDA receptor dependent.},

After the birth, there is no endocrinological response to stressors between post-natal 4 and 14th days, which is called stress-hyporesponsive period (SHRP) in rats. This hypo-responsiveness is time- and stressor-specific, as some more severe stressors have been shown to induce a stress response. The present study examined the effects of maternal deprivation on oxidative stress in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum regions of the brain both during and after SHRP of the infant rats. The results showed that maternal deprivation in SHRP increased antioxidant enzyme activities and reduced lipid peroxidation in infant rat brain. However, by the termination of SHRP, maternal deprivation reduced enzyme activities and increased lipid peroxidation. The results indicated that infant brain might be protected in SHRP from maternal deprivation-induced oxidative stress.},

Excitatory synapses are considered as key elements in synaptic plasticity and behavioral adaptation. The review summarizes data on the mechanisms of glucocorticoid regulation of the glutamatergic synapse, primarily on the examples of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Glucocorticoids, by triggering signal transduction through mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors located on synaptic membranes and in the cytosol of glutamatergic neurons, regulate synapse plasticity at the level of pre and postsynaptic compartments. Glucocorticoids modulate synapse excitability through changes in vesicular transport and glutamate release, and mediate changes in the expression, composition, and properties of ionotropic NMDA and AMPA receptors, as well as other glutamate receptors. A detailed scheme of multiple regulatory mechanisms implemented in the glutamatergic synapse during the binding of glucocorticoids to specific receptors is presented.},

	abstract = {Lord Howe Island (LHI) is a remote oceanic island in the south-west Pacific that is World Heritage listed due to its diverse, and largely endemic, biota. A suite of introduced species have colonised the island, resulting in the widespread population declines of many native species. The delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata De Vis) was accidentally introduced to LHI from mainland eastern Australia, but there has been no detailed investigation of its biology on the island, or its potential impact on the native biota. We conducted a detailed study of the distribution and biology of the delicate skink on LHI over a six-year period (2007--12). The delicate skink was introduced to LHI in the 1980s, and rapidly spread across the island. It presently occurs in all 21 low-elevation vegetation communities on LHI. The delicate skink is diurnal on LHI, and displays seasonal variation in activity with a peak in November--December. The delicate skink exhibits sexual dimorphism with females having larger body and abdomen sizes and males having longer and broader heads, although the degree of genetic admixture may influence morphology on LHI. Females reproduce in spring and summer (September--February), with a positive relationship between body size and clutch size. Clutch size ranges from 1 to 7 (mean 3.4) and communal egg nests (11--200+ eggs) are common. Tail loss is common on LHI (55\%), but is more frequent in adults and females. We conclude that, based on its distribution and abundance, the delicate skink has the potential to impact the diverse and endemic invertebrate fauna on LHI.},

	abstract = {Invasive species represent a select subset of organisms that have successfully transitioned through each stage of the introduction process (transportation, establishment, and spread). Although there is a growing realization that behavior plays a critical role in invasion success, few studies have focused on the initial stages of introduction. We examined whether differences in the grouping tendencies and exploratory behavior of two sympatric lizard species could contribute to their divergent invasion success. While the nondirected activity of the two species did not differ, the invasive delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata) was found to be more exploratory than the congeneric noninvasive garden skink (L. guichenoti), which enabled it to more effectively locate novel environments and basking site resources. The delicate skink also exhibited a greater tendency to hide, which may act to enhance its probability of ensnarement in freight and cargo and decrease its likelihood of detection during transit. The grouping tendencies of the two species did not differ. Together, our results suggest that while the two species have an equivalent ``opportunity'' for unintentional human-assisted transportation, several pre-existing behavioral traits may enhance the success of the delicate skink in negotiating the initial stages of the introduction process, and subsequent post-establishment spread.},

We show that males perform better than females in a biologically relevant spatial learning task. This is the first evidence for sex differences in learning in a reptile, and we argue that it is probably owing to sex-specific selective pressures that may be widespread in lizards. Across the sexes, we found a clear association between boldness after a simulated predatory attack and the probability of learning the spatial task. In contrast to previous studies, we found a nonlinear association between boldness and learning: both `bold' and `shy' behavioural types were more successful learners than intermediate males. Our results do not fit with recent predictions suggesting that individual differences in learning may be linked with behavioural types via high--low-risk/reward trade-offs. We suggest the possibility that differences in spatial cognitive performance may arise in lizards as a consequence of the distinct environmental variability and complexity experienced by individuals as a result of their sex and social tactics.},

Our hypotheses are based largely on a connection between fast--slow behavioural types (BTs; e.g. boldness, aggressiveness, exploration tendency) and cognitive speed--accuracy trade-offs. We also discuss connections between BTs, cognition and ecologically important aspects of decision-making, including sampling, impulsivity, risk sensitivity and choosiness.

In transgenic AD-type mice overexpressing mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) and A␤ (mAPP), CypD deficiency improves mitochondrial and synaptic function and learning/memory up to 12 months old. Here we provide evidence of the protective effects of CypD deficiency in aged AD mice (22--24 months). Cyp D deficient mAPP mice demonstrate less calcium-induced mitochondrial swelling, increased mitochondrial calcium uptake capacity, preserved mitochondrial respiratory function and improved spatial learning/memory even in old age (known to be the age for late stage AD pathology and synaptic dysfunction). These data demonstrate that abrogation of CypD results in persistent life-long protection against A␤ toxicity in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model, thereby suggesting that blockade of CypD may be of benefit for Alzheimer disease treatment.},

@article{coomber_independent_1997,
	abstract = {The extent to which variation within and between the sexes can be assigned to genes vs. environment is problematic, because, in most vertebrates, males and females differ genetically. However, factors other than sex chromosomes and the consequent sex-typical gonadal hormone secretions may play important roles in the differentiation of the neural mechanisms underlying individual and sex differences in aggressive and sexual behavior. The leopard gecko, like many oviparous reptiles, lacks sex chromosomes. Instead, gonadal sex is determined by temperature during embryogenesis, with low and high incubation temperatures producing females and intermediate temperatures producing mixed sex ratios. In essence, this allows for the study of individual and sex differences without the confounding variable of genetically determined gender. Experiments have shown that the temperature experienced during incubation plays a critical role in establishing the adult morphological, endocrinological, and behavioral phenotype. In this experiment, the independent effects of incubation temperature and gonadal sex on the morphology and metabolic capacity of specific brain nuclei were determined. Both individual and sex differences in the volume of the preoptic area and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus are determined primarily by incubation temperature, not by gonadal sex. However, incubation temperature and gonadal sex are both important in determining the metabolic capacity in the anterior hypothalamus, external amygdala, dorsal lateral nucleus of the hypothalamus, dorsal lateral nucleus of the thalamus, dorsal ventricular ridge, habenula, lateral hypothalamus, nucleus rotundus, nucleus sphericus, periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, preoptic area, periventricular nucleus of the preoptic area, septum, striatum, torus semicircularis, and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. This is the first demonstration in a vertebrate that factors other than gonadal sex hormones, which arise from the individual's genetic constitution, can affect the sexual differentiation of the brain.

@article{crino_corticosterone_2014,
	abstract = {Animals exposed to stress during development experience sustained morphological, physiological, neurological, and behavioral consequences. For example, elevated glucocorticoids (GCs) during development can increase GC secretion in adults. Studies have examined the sustained effects of elevated developmental GCs on total GC responses, but no study to date has examined the effect of developmental stress on corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG). CBG is a protein which binds to GCs and facilitates their transportation in blood. When bound to CBG, GCs are unavailable to interact with target tissues. Exposure to stress can decrease CBG capacity and, thus, increase free GCs (the portion of unbound GCs). We examined the long-term effects of elevated corticosterone (CORT) during development (12--28 days post-hatch) on acute stress responses, negative feedback, and CBG capacity at 30, 60, and 90 days post-hatch in zebra finches. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of CORT treatment on body size and condition at 28, 60, and 90 days post-hatch. CORT exposed birds had higher acute stress responses at 30 days post-hatch compared to control birds. However, there was no treatment effect at 60 or 90 days post-hatch. CBG levels were not affected by treatment, and so free CORT estimations reflected patterns in total CORT. CORT treatment decreased growth and condition in zebra finches at 28 days post-hatch, but these differences were not present at later life history stages. However, brood size had a sustained effect on body size such that birds reared in medium sized broods were larger at 28, 60, and 90 days post-hatch. These results demonstrate the complexity of early environmental effects on adult phenotype and suggest that some conditions may have stronger programmatic effects than others.},

@article{monaghan_organismal_2014,
	abstract = {Most organisms, including ourselves, are exposed to environmental stressors at various points during life, and responses to such stressors have been optimised by evolution to give the best fitness outcomes. It is expected that environmental change will substantially increase long-term stress exposure in many animal groups in the coming decades. A major challenge for biologists is to understand and predict how this will influence individuals, populations and ecosystems, and over what time scale such effects will occur. This requires a multi-disciplinary approach, combining studies of mechanisms with studies of fitness consequences for individuals and their descendants. In this review, I discuss the positive and negative fitness consequences of responses to stressful environments, particularly during early life, and with an emphasis on studies in birds. As many of the mechanisms underlying stress responses are highly conserved across the vertebrate groups, the findings from these studies have general applicability when interpreted in a life history context. One important route that has recently been identified whereby chronic stress exposure can affect health and longevity over long time frames is via effects on telomere dynamics. Much of this work has so far been done on humans, and is correlational in nature, but studies on other taxa, and experimental work, are increasing. I summarise the relevant aspects of vertebrate telomere biology and critically appraise our current knowledge with a view to pointing out important future research directions for our understanding of how stress exposure influences life histories.},

@article{mather_individual_2012,
	abstract = {Prey choice is often evaluated at the species or population level. Here, we analyzed the diet of octopuses of different populations with the aim to assess the importance of individual feeding habits as a factor affecting prey choice. Two methods were used, an assessment of the extent to which an individual octopus made choices of species representative of those population (PSi and IS) and 25\% cutoff values for number of choices and percentage intake of individual on their prey. In one population of Octopus cf vulgaris in Bermuda individuals were generalist by IS=0.77, but most chose many prey of the same species, and were specialists on it by {\textgreater}75\% intake. Another population had a wider prey selection, still generalist with PSi=0.66, but two individuals specialized by choices. In Bonaire, there was a wide range of prey species chosen, and the population was specialists by IS= 0.42. Individual choices revealed seven specialists and four generalists. A population of Octopus cyanea in Hawaii all had similar choices of crustaceans, so the population was generalist by IS with 0.74. But by individual choices, three were considered a specialist. A population of Enteroctopus dofleini from Puget Sound had a wide range of preferences, in which seven were also specialists, IS=0.53. By individual choices, thirteen were also specialists. Given the octopus specialty of learning during foraging, we hypothesize that both localized prey availability and individual personality differences could influence the exploration for prey and this translates into different prey choices across individuals and populations showed in this study [Current Zoology 58 (4): 597−603, 2012].},

@article{miranda_maternal_2018,
	abstract = {An adverse maternal hormonal environment during pregnancy can be associated with abnormal brain growth. Subtle changes in fetal brain development have been observed even for maternal hormone levels within the currently accepted physiologic ranges. In this review, we provide an update of the research data on maternal hormonal impact on fetal neurodevelopment, giving particular emphasis to thyroid hormones and glucocorticoids. Thyroid hormones are required for normal brain development. Despite serum TSH appearing to be the most accurate indicator of thyroid function in -pregnancy, maternal serum free T4 levels in the first trimester of pregnancy are the major determinant of postnatal psychomotor development. Even a transient period of maternal hypothyroxinemia at the beginning of neurogenesis can confer a higher risk of expressive language and nonverbal cognitive delays in offspring. Nevertheless, most recent clinical guidelines advocate for targeted high--risk case finding during first trimester of pregnancy despite universal thyroid function screening. Corticosteroids are determinant in suppressing cell proliferation and stimulating terminal differentiation, a fundamental switch for the maturation of fetal organs. Not surprisingly, intrauterine exposure to stress or high levels of glucocorticoids, endogenous or synthetic, has a molecular and structural impact on brain development and appears to impair cognition and increase anxiety and reactivity to stress. Limbic regions, such as hippocampus and amygdala, are particularly sensitive. Repeated doses of prenatal corticosteroids seem to have short--term benefits of less respiratory distress and fewer serious health problems in offspring. Nevertheless, neurodevelopmental growth in later childhood and adulthood needs further clarification. Future studies should address the relevance of monitoring the level of thyroid hormones and corticosteroids during pregnancy in the risk stratification for impaired postnatal neurodevelopment.},

@article{belliure_prenatal_2004,
	abstract = {Many animals exhibit dramatic responses when subjected to a stressor. A classic marker of the stress response is an increase in plasma glucocorticoids, but this constitutes only one step in the cascade from experience of a stressor to wider organismal changes, including behavior. The behavioral sensitivity to glucocorticoids would determine the consequences of the stress-related alteration of behavior for the organism. In this study we explored, under laboratory conditions, the prenatal and postnatal effects of corticosterone on activity and thermoregulation of juveniles of the common lizard, Lacerta vivipara. Activity was measured as the time spent moving and the time spent scratching the wall in an empty terrarium. Thermoregulatory behavior was measured as the time spent motionless under a light bulb. Activity and thermoregulation of juveniles of the common lizard showed a different sensitivity to prenatal and postnatal corticosterone treatment, modulated by juvenile sex and maternal condition. Prenatal corticosterone manipulation influenced the time spent moving in both sexes. By contrast, only juvenile females increased the time spent scratching the walls of the terrarium when corticosterone was delivered both at the prenatal and postnatal stage. Prenatal hormone manipulation increased the time spent basking by juveniles issued from large females. These results suggest that, in addition to influencing a variety of behavioral and morphological traits, corticosterone may also play an important role in the regulation of activity and thermoregulation of juvenile lizards, modulated by individual sex and maternal condition.

@article{castelli_corticosterone_2021,
	abstract = {Environmental sex determination (ESD) is common among ectothermic vertebrates. The stress axis and production of stress hormones (corticosteroids) regulates ESD in fish, but evidence of a similar influence in reptiles is sparse and conflicting. The central bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps) has a system of sex determination involving the interplay between sex chromosomes (ZZ/ZW female heterogamety) and the thermal environment. High egg incubation temperatures induce sex reversal of the ZZ genotype, feminizing chromosomally male individuals. Here we show that corticosterone elevation is not associated with sex reversal in the central bearded dragon, either during embryonic development or adulthood. We also demonstrate experimentally that sex determination is not affected by corticosterone injection into the yolk. This strongly suggests that stress axis upregulation by high temperature during incubation does not cause sex reversal in P. vitticeps. Our work is in general agreement with other research in reptiles, which suggests that the stress axis does not mediate sex in reptiles with ESD. Alternative biological systems may be responsible for capturing environmental conditions during reptile development, such as cellular calcium and redox regulation or the action of temperature‐sensitive splicing factors.},

Female morphs differed in home-range distribution patterns and corticosterone levels in relation to the density and frequency of their female neighbours. Levels of plasma corticosterone of yellow-throated females increased with increased density of both morphs. In contrast, orangethroated females had reduced levels of corticosterone in response to increased density of orange females. Additionally, females with lower corticosterone survived poorly, suggesting that social interactions and high local densities of orange females may be potentially costly for orange females. These results are consistent with decreased fitness effects and suppression of immune function previously reported for orange female morphs surrounded by more orange neighbours. These correlations, in conjunction with previous work in this system, indicate that corticosterone is likely to be an important physiological mechanism regulating female fitness in nature.},

	abstract = {Opportunistic breeding is a strategy used to maximize reproductive success in unpredictable environments. Birds that breed opportunistically are thought to maintain partial activation of the reproductive axis in order to rapidly initiate breeding when environmental conditions become suitable. The physiological mechanisms that modulate reproduction in seasonally breeding birds have been well explored. In contrast, the physiological mechanisms that allow opportunistic breeding birds to maintain a continued state of reproductive readiness has not been well established. Here, we tested the hypothesis that reproductive readiness is modulated through condition-mediated effects on the hypothalamic--pituitaryadre nal (HPA) axis and its downstream effects on corticosterone (CORT) secretion in wild zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). We examined the variation in body condition, HPA-axis activity (endogenous and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-induced responses), and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis activity activity (baseline and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) induced testosterone and estradiol levels) in zebra finches across five sites in the Northern Territory in Australia. We found that birds at the sites in the lowest condition had the highest level of baseline and peak CORT. Additionally, males at the sites in the lowest condition had the highest fold increase in testosterone following a GnRH challenge. Across sites, birds with low body condition had high baseline, peak, and ACTHinduced levels of CORT. Our data suggest that reproductive readiness in opportunistically breeding birds is modulated by condition-mediated trade-offs between the HPA- and the HPG-axes. Further work is needed to understand the environmental conditions that influence reproductive activation in opportunistically breeding birds.},

@article{harris_glucocorticoids_2011,
	abstract = {An adverse foetal environment is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular, metabolic, neuroendocrine and psychological disorders in adulthood. Exposure to stress and its glucocorticoid hormone mediators may underpin this association. In humans and in animal models, prenatal stress, excess exogenous glucocorticoids or inhibition of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD2; the placental barrier to maternal glucocorticoids) reduces birth weight and causes hyperglycemia, hypertension, increased HPA axis reactivity, and increased anxiety-related behaviour. Molecular mechanisms that underlie the `developmental programming' effects of excess glucocorticoids/prenatal stress include epigenetic changes in target gene promoters. In the case of the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor (GR), this alters tissue-specific GR expression levels, which has persistent and profound effects on glucocorticoid signalling in certain tissues (e.g. brain, liver, and adipose). Crucially, changes in gene expression persist long after the initial challenge, predisposing the individual to disease in later life. Intriguingly, the effects of a challenged pregnancy appear to be transmitted possibly to one or two subsequent generations, suggesting that these epigenetic effects persist.},

Here, we tested whether exposure to high yolk corticosterone was responsible for the slowed growth and elevated HPA responsiveness by manipulating the steroid content of eggs directly. Eggs were injected prior to incubation with a dose of corticosterone calculated to increase total yolk corticosterone concentration by two standard deviations. We found that elevated yolk corticosterone slowed growth in male but not female chicks and decreased the HPA responsiveness of female but not male adults, in contrast to the results of elevated corticosterone in laying females. Our results are consistent with others that demonstrate sex diVerences in the organizational eVects of glucocorticoids. The mechanisms and adaptive value of such diVerences have yet to be determined.},

@article{henriksen_prenatal_2011,
	abstract = {Although most work on prenatal stress has been conducted on mammalian species, birds provide useful alternative models since avian embryos develop outside the mother's body in a concealed environment, the egg, which is produced during a short time window of 4--14 days. This facilitates measurement of maternal substances provided for and manipulation of the embryo without interfering with the mother's physiology. We critically review prenatal corticosterone mediated effects in birds by reviewing both studies were females had elevated levels of plasma corticosterone during egg formation and studies applying corticosterone injections directly into the egg. A selected review of the mammalian literature is used as background. The results suggest that besides prenatal exposure to corticosterone itself, maternal corticosterone affects offspring's behaviour and physiology via alteration of other egg components. However, results are inconsistent, perhaps due to the interaction with variation in the post-natal environment, sex, age, developmental mode and details of treatment. The potential role of adaptive maternal programming has not been tested adequately and suggestions for future research are discussed.},

It is still unclear whether prenatal stress can induce long-lasting modifications in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. To test this possibility the effects of restraint stress in pregnant rats during the third week of gestation were investigated in the functional proper'ties of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and hippocampal type I and type II corticosteroid receptors in the male offspring at 3, 21 and 90 days of age. Plasma corticosterone was significantly elevated in prenatally-stressed rats-at 3 and 21 days after exposure to novelty. At 90 days of age, prenatally-stressed rats showed a longer duration of corticosterone secretion after exposure to novelty. No change was observed for type I and type II receptor densities 3 days after birth, but both receptor subtypes were decreased in the hippocampus of prenatally-stressed offspring at 21 and 90 days of life. These findings suggest that prenatal stress produces long term changes in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in the offspring.},

@article{jeanniard_du_dot_changes_2009,
	abstract = {Physiological responses to changes in energy balance are tightly regulated by the endocrine system through glucocorticoids, IGF-I and thyroid hormones. Changes in these hormones were studied in eight captive female Steller sea lions that experienced changes in food intake, body mass, body composition, and blood metabolites during summer and winter. During a period of energy restriction, one group of sea lions was fed reduced amounts of Pacific herring and another was fed an isocaloric diet of walleye pollock, after which both groups returned to their pre-experimental diets of herring. Cortisol was negatively and IGF-I was positively associated with changes in body mass during periods of energy restriction (mass loss associated with increase in cortisol and decrease in IGF-I) and refeeding (body mass maintenance associated with stable hormone concentrations in summer and compensatory growth linked to decrease in cortisol and increase in IGF-I in winter). Cortisol and IGF-I were also correlated with changes in lipid and lean mass, respectively. Consequently, these two hormones likely make adequate biomarkers for nutritional stress in sea lions, and when combined provide indication of the energetic strategy (lipid vs lean mass catabolism) animals adopt to cope with changes in nutrient intake. Unlike type of diet fed to the sea lions, age of the animals also impacted hormonal responses, with younger animals showing more intense hormonal changes to nutritional stress. Thyroid hormones, however, were not linked to any physiological changes observed in this study.},

@article{karatsoreos_disruption_2011,
	abstract = {Circadian (daily) rhythms are present in almost all plants and animals. In mammals, a brain clock located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus maintains synchrony between environmental light/dark cycles and physiology and behavior. Over the past 100 y, especially with the advent of electric lighting, modern society has resulted in a round-the-clock lifestyle, in which natural connections between rest/activity cycles and environmental light/dark cycles have been degraded or even broken. Instances in which rapid changes to sleep patterns are necessary, such as transmeridian air travel, demonstrate negative effects of acute circadian disruption on physiology and behavior. However, the ramifications of chronic disruption of the circadian clock for mental and physical health are not yet fully understood. By housing mice in 20-h light/dark cycles, incongruous with their endogenous ∼24-h circadian period, we were able to model the effects of chronic circadian disruption noninvasively. Housing in these conditions results in accelerated weight gain and obesity, as well as changes in metabolic hormones. In the brain, circadian-disrupted mice exhibit a loss of dendritic length and decreased complexity of neurons in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex, a brain region important in executive function and emotional control. Disrupted animals show decreases in cognitive flexibility and changes in emotionality consistent with the changes seen in neural architecture. How our findings translate to humans living and working in chronic circadian disruption is unknown, but we believe that this model can provide a foundation to understand how environmental disruption of circadian rhythms impacts the brain, behavior, and physiology.},

@article{landys_rearing_2011,
	abstract = {In captivity, the adrenocortical stress response can be permanently altered by events that occur during early life. Free-living animals have rarely been examined in this regard. To examine whether early-life events impact the hypothalamo--pituitary--adrenal (HPA) axis in the natural setting, we evaluated the stress response of free-living interspecifically cross-fostered great tits (Parus major). Cross-fostered birds may show a long-term potentiation of the adrenocortical stress response because species-specific nutritional requirements may not be met in the nest and/or cross-fostered birds may experience psychosocial stress while being raised by heterospecifics. Nevertheless, we hypothesized that in the natural setting, programmed changes in HPA function would be eclipsed by reactive responses to the immediate environment. Thus, we predicted that adult cross-fostered great tits and controls would show no differences in their adrenocortical stress response. Contrary to predictions, we found that stress responsiveness (i.e., the rate of the corticosterone increase associated with capture and handling) was significantly higher in cross-fostered great tits than in controls. Further, stress responsiveness was not significantly different between mature adults and first-year juveniles. Thus, data indicate significant effects of early rearing conditions on adrenocortical reactivity in the natural setting and also suggest that effects of rearing conditions in free-living animals can last into adulthood.},

@article{love_plasticity_2008,
	abstract = {Optimal functioning of the hypothalamo--pituitary--adrenal (HPA) axis is paramount to maximizing fitness in vertebrates. Research in laboratory mammals has suggested that maternally-induced stress can cause significant variation in the responsiveness of an offspring's HPA axis involving both pre- and post-natal developmental mechanisms. However, very little is known regarding effects of maternal stress on the variability of offspring adrenocortical functioning in free-living vertebrates. Here we use an experimental approach that independently lowers the quality of both the pre- and post-natal developmental environment to examine programming and plasticity in the responsiveness of the HPA axis in fledglings of a free-living passerine, the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). We found that mimicking a hormonal signal of poor maternal condition via an experimental prenatal increase in yolk corticosterone decreased the subsequent responsiveness of the HPA axis in fledglings. Conversely, decreasing the quality of the post-natal developmental environment (by decreasing maternal provisioning capability via a maternal feather-clipping manipulation) increased subsequent responsiveness of the HPA axis in fledglings, apparently through direct effects on nestling body condition. The plasticity of these responses was sex-specific with smaller female offspring showing the largest increase in HPA reactivity. We suggest that pre-natal, corticosterone-induced, plasticity in the HPA axis may be a `predictive adaptive response' (PAR): a form of adaptive developmental plasticity where the advantage of the induced phenotype is manifested in a future life-history stage. Further, we introduce a new term to define the condition-driven post-natal plasticity of the HPA axis to an unpredictable post-natal environment, namely a `reactive adaptive response' (RAR). This study confirms that the quality of both the preand post-natal developmental environment can be a significant source of variation in the responsiveness of the HPA axis, and provides a frame-work for examining ecologically-relevant sources of stress-induced programming and plasticity in this endocrine system in a free-living vertebrate, respectively. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Maternal glucocorticoids are known to affect offspring phenotype in numerous vertebrate taxa. In birds, the maternal transfer of corticosterone to eggs was recently proposed as a hormonal mechanism by which offspring phenotype is matched to the relative quality of the maternal environment. However, current hypotheses lack supporting information on both intra- and inter-clutch variation in yolk corticosterone for wild birds. As such, we examined variation in yolk corticosterone levels in a wild population of European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Maternal condition, clutch size and nesting density were all negatively related to yolk corticosterone deposition; females with high condition indices, those laying larger clutches and those nesting in high-density associations deposited lower amounts of the hormone into eggs than those with low condition indices, laying small clutches and nesting in isolation. Alternatively, we found no effects of maternal age or human disturbance on yolk corticosterone deposition. Intraclutch variation of yolk corticosterone was significant, with levels increasing across the laying sequence in all clutch sizes examined, with the difference between first and last-laid eggs being greater in large versus small clutches. Given the reported effects of yolk corticosterone on offspring size and growth, intra-clutch variation in yolk corticosterone has the potential to alter the competitive environment within a brood. Furthermore, our results indicate that variation in yolk corticosterone can originate from variation in both the mother's quality as well as the quality of her breeding environment. The presence of inter-female variation in particular is an important pre-requisite in testing whether the exposure of offspring to maternally-derived corticosterone is a mechanistic link between offspring phenotypic plasticity and maternal quality.},

	abstract = {The survival and quality of progeny can be strongly influenced by nongenetic effects derived from the physiological condition of the mother during gametogenesis. The influence of maternal condition on the size and quality of larvae at dispersal was examined for the tropical damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, through a series of field studies during 1994. In this species, males guard a demersal nest of eggs contributed to by nearby females. The largest and most dominant female stays near the nest and contributes most to the egg clutches, limiting egg contributions from subordinate females. Maternal effects dramatically influenced the size of larval progeny at hatching, four days after laying. Much of the variability in progeny size was explained by levels of the stress-associated steroid hormone, cortisol, in the female. A field experiment manipulating maternal levels of cortisol found that cortisol levels strongly influenced the morphology and yolk size of larval progeny at hatching. Variation in the density of egg predators and competitors together explained 38\% of the observed variance in maternal cortisol levels. These competitors and predatory fish appear to elevate maternal cortisol levels and consequently influence larval morphology through a stress-related response. This study suggests that the behavioral interaction regime of a fish population can determine larval quality and potentially govern a female's contribution to the next generation.},

	abstract = {Living organisms have regular patterns and routines that involve obtaining food and carrying out life history stages such as breeding, migrating, molting, and hibernating. The acquisition, utilization, and storage of energy reserves (and other resources) are critical to lifetime reproductive success. There are also responses to predictable changes, e.g., seasonal, and unpredictable challenges, i.e., storms and natural disasters. Social organization in many populations provides advantages through cooperation in providing basic necessities and beneficial social support. But there are disadvantages owing to conflict in social hierarchies and competition for resources. Here we discuss the concept of allostasis, maintaining stability through change, as a fundamental process through which organisms actively adjust to both predictable and unpredictable events. Allostatic load refers to the cumulative cost to the body of allostasis, with allostatic overload being a state in which serious pathophysiology can occur. Using the balance between energy input and expenditure as the basis for applying the concept of allostasis, we propose two types of allostatic overload. Type 1 allostatic overload occurs when energy demand exceeds supply, resulting in activation of the emergency life history stage. This serves to direct the animal away from normal life history stages into a survival mode that decreases allostatic load and regains positive energy balance. The normal life cycle can be resumed when the perturbation passes. Type 2 allostatic overload begins when there is sufficient or even excess energy consumption accompanied by social conflict and other types of social dysfunction. The latter is the case in human society and certain situations affecting animals in captivity. In all cases, secretion of glucocorticosteroids and activity of other mediators of allostasis such as the autonomic nervous system, CNS neurotransmitters, and inflammatory cytokines wax and wane with allostatic load. If allostatic load is chronically high, then pathologies develop. Type 2 allostatic overload does not trigger an escape response, and can only be counteracted through learning and changes in the social structure.},

	abstract = {Hormones are an important interface between genome and environment, because of their ability to modify the phenotype. More particularly, glucocorticoids are known to affect both morphological, physiological and behavioral traits. Many studies suggest that prenatal stress (associated with an elevation of corticosterone) has deleterious effects on offspring, an altered physiology resulting in retardation of fetal growth and higher percentage of dead neonates. In this study, we investigate the consequences of an artificial increase of corticosterone in pregnant female Lacerta vivipara on two important fitness components: growth and survival. Do stressed females decrease or enhance offspring survival? In 2000 and 2001, we collected pregnant females from four populations of the C2vennes and kept them in the laboratory until parturition. We applied a corticosterone solution daily onto the backs of some females. A similar solution, but without corticosterone, was applied to the remaining females as a control. Immediately after birth, we measured juveniles' morphological characteristics and released them on the field. In September of the year of release and in May of the following year, we recaptured offspring to estimate growth and survival. The elevation of the corticosterone level in pregnant females L. vivipara had a profound impact on juvenile traits. The size, the body condition and the growth of juveniles were decreased by the corticosterone treatment. In contrast, in male juveniles, survival was higher for juveniles from corticosterone-treated females than from placebo females. Thus, corticosterone does not seem to have detrimental effects on offspring survival, suggesting that it may have an adaptive function.},

The link between song and quality comes about because the brain structures underlying song learning largely develop during the first few months post-hatching. During this same period, songbirds are likely to be subject to nutritional and other stresses. Only individuals faring well in the face of stress are able to invest the resources in brain development necessary to optimize song learning. Learned features of song thus become reliable indicators of male quality, with reliability maintained by the developmental costs of song. We review the background and assumptions of the nutritional stress hypothesis, and present new experimental data demonstrating an effect of nestling nutrition on nestling growth, brain development, and song learning, providing support for a key prediction of the hypothesis.},

We investigated how maternal stress hormones differentially affected sons and daughters by manipulating levels of the glucocorticoid, corticosterone (CORT), in gravid female eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) and quantifying reproductive investment and sex ratio of resulting clutches, and the mass, snout-vent length, and body condition of sons versus daughters at hatching. We found no effect of maternal CORT-treatment on the number or size of eggs laid or on the sex ratio of resulting offspring, but sons of CORTtreated mothers were shorter, lighter, and of poorer body condition at hatching than were sons of control mothers.

              The glucocorticoid stress response is frequently used to indicate vertebrate response to the environment. Body temperature may affect glucocorticoid concentrations, particularly in ectotherms. We conducted lab manipulations and field measurements to test the effects of body temperature on plasma corticosterone (predominant glucocorticoid in reptiles) in eastern fence lizards (
              Sceloporus undulatus
              )
              .
              First, we acclimated lizards to one of 4 treatments: 22 $\,^{\circ}$C, 29 $\,^{\circ}$C, 33 $\,^{\circ}$C, or 36 $\,^{\circ}$C, and measured cloacal temperatures and plasma corticosterone concentrations at baseline and after exposure to a standardized stressor (cloth bag). Both baseline and stress-induced corticosterone concentrations were lower in lizards with lower body temperatures. Second, we acclimated lizards to 22 $\,^{\circ}$C or 29 $\,^{\circ}$C and exposed them to a standardized (cloth bag) stressor for 3 to 41 min. Lizards acclimated to 29 $\,^{\circ}$C showed a robust increase in plasma corticosterone concentrations with restraint stress, but those at 22 $\,^{\circ}$C showed no such increases in corticosterone concentrations. Third, we measured lizards upon capture from the field. There was no correlation between body temperature and baseline plasma corticosterone in field-caught lizards. These results suggest body temperature can significantly affect plasma corticosterone concentrations in reptiles, which may be of particular concern for experiments conducted under laboratory conditions but may not translate to the field.},

	abstract = {During embryonic development, viviparous offspring are exposed to maternally circulating hormones. Maternal stress increases offspring exposure to corticosterone and this hormonal exposure has the potential to influence developmental, morphological and behavioral traits of the resulting offspring. We treated pregnant female garter snakes (Thamnophis elegans) with low levels of corticosterone after determining both natural corticosterone levels in the field and pre-treatment levels upon arrival in the lab. Additional measurements of plasma corticosterone were taken at days 1, 5, and 10 during the 10-day exposure, which occurred during the last third of gestation (of 4-month gestation). These pregnant snakes were from replicate populations of fast- and slow-growth ecotypes occurring in Northern California, with concomitant short and long lifespans. Field corticosterone levels of pregnant females of the slow-growth ecotype were an order of magnitude higher than fast-growth dams. In the laboratory, corticosterone levels increased over the 10 days of corticosterone manipulation for animals of both ecotypes, and reached similar plateaus for both control and treated dams. Despite similar plasma corticosterone levels in treated and control mothers, corticosterone-treated dams produced more stillborn offspring and exhibited higher total reproductive failure than control dams. At one month of age, offspring from fast-growth females had higher plasma corticosterone levels than offspring from slow-growth females, which is opposite the maternal pattern. Offspring from corticosterone-treated mothers, although unaffected in their slither speed, exhibited changes in escape behaviors and morphology that were dependent upon maternal ecotype. Offspring from corticosterone-treated fast-growth females exhibited less anti-predator reversal behavior; offspring from corticosterone-treated slow-growth females exhibited less anti-predator tail lashing behavior.},

@article{romero_seasonal_1998,
	abstract = {Recent work indicates that Gambel's white-crowned sparrows modulate corticosterone release seasonally in response to capture and restraint. Free-living white-crowned sparrows dramatically elevate both baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels during the breeding season compared with either wintering or migrating birds. Although corticosteroid binding globulin capacity also rises during breeding, it does not fully compensate for elevated glucocorticoid levels. Consequently, we examined what hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis changes could account for seasonal changes in glucocorticoid levels. During winter and fall migration, exogenous ACTH failed to elevate corticosterone levels beyond the response to capture and handling, suggesting that the adrenal's ability to release corticosterone limits circulating levels during these seasons. In contrast, not only were corticosterone levels higher during breeding, but adrenals further responded to an exogenous ACTH signal, indicating a dramatic enhancement of the adrenal's ability to secrete corticosterone. Furthermore, we inferred the pituitary's ACTH secretory ability by injecting exogenous corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), arginine vasotocin (AVT) and mesotocin and measured corticosterone release. Pituitaries in breeding birds appear to respond to exogenous CRF and AVT, suggesting hypothalamic control of corticosterone release during this season. Taken together, these results suggest that seasonal modulation of corticosterone release in this species is controlled primarily at the adrenal. comp biochem physiol 119C;1:31--36, 1998. {\copyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.},

@article{romero_reactive_2009,
	abstract = {Allostasis, the concept of maintaining stability through change, has been proposed as a term and a model to replace the ambiguous term of stress, the concept of adequately or inadequately coping with threatening or unpredictable environmental stimuli. However, both the term allostasis and its underlying model have generated criticism. Here we propose the Reactive Scope Model, an alternate graphical model that builds on the strengths of allostasis and traditional concepts of stress yet addresses many of the criticisms. The basic model proposes divergent effects in four ranges for the concentrations or levels of various physiological mediators involved in responding to stress. (1) Predictive Homeostasis is the range encompassing circadian and seasonal variation --- the concentrations/levels needed to respond to predictable environmental changes. (2) Reactive Homeostasis is the range of the mediator needed to respond to unpredictable or threatening environmental changes. Together, Predictive and Reactive Homeostasis comprise the normal reactive scope of the mediator for that individual. Concentrations/levels above the Reactive Homeostasis range is (3) Homeostatic Overload, and concentrations/levels below the Predictive Homeostasis range is (4) Homeostatic Failure. These two ranges represent concentrations/levels with pathological effects and are not compatible with long-term (Homeostatic Overload) or short-term (Homeostatic Failure) health. Wear and tear is the concept that there is a cost to maintaining physiological systems in the Reactive Homeostasis range, so that over time these systems gradually lose their ability to counteract threatening and unpredictable stimuli. Wear and tear can be modeled by a decrease in the threshold between Reactive Homeostasis and Homeostatic Overload, i.e. a decrease in reactive scope. This basic model can then be modified by altering the threshold between Reactive Homeostasis and Homeostatic Overload to help understand how an individual's response to environmental stressors can differ depending upon factors such as prior stressors, dominance status, and early life experience. We illustrate the benefits of the Reactive Scope Model and contrast it with the traditional model and with allostasis in the context of chronic malnutrition, changes in social status, and changes in stress responses due to early life experiences. The Reactive Scope Model, as an extension of allostasis, should be useful to both biomedical researchers studying laboratory animals and humans, as well as ecologists studying stress in free-living animals.},

@article{saino_stressed_2005,
	abstract = {Organisms frequently encounter stressful ecological conditions. In vertebrates, a major mechanism of physiological response to stress is mediated by the hypothalamic--pituitary--adrenal axis and results in increased secretion of glucocorticosteroids, which can have adverse consequences on diverse phenotypic traits affecting fitness. Maternal stress may thus have carryover effects on progeny if it influences pre-natal offspring environment in terms of glucocorticosteroid concentration, although this hypothesis has never been tested in any species under field conditions. We manipulated stress experienced by female barn swallows Hirundo rustica, by exposing them to a predator during laying and measured egg corticosterone concentration. Stressed females laid eggs with greater corticosterone concentration than controls exposed to a herbivore. In another experiment, we injected physiological doses of corticosterone in the egg albumen and compared the phenotype of offspring originating from these eggs with their control siblings originating from either sham-inoculated or unmanipulated eggs and reared in the same nest. Eggs injected with corticosterone had lower hatchability and produced fledglings with smaller body size and slower plumage development than did control eggs. Nestling body size in our study population predicts long-term survival. Thus, maternal stress impaired offspring phenotype and viability by increasing transmission of glucocorticosteroids to the eggs. This study identifies a novel mechanism mediating early maternal effects whereby maternal stress affects offspring quality. These results are relevant to biological conservation because they disclose a mechanism that can link environmental conditions to population productivity and viability. J. Exp.

@article{schoech_short-_2011,
	abstract = {A growing body of evidence from across taxa suggests that exposure to elevated levels of glucocorticoids during early development can have long-term effects upon physiological and behavioral phenotypes. Additionally, there is some, though limited, evidence that similar early exposure can also negatively impact cognitive ability. Following pioneering mammalian studies, several avian studies have revealed that the responsiveness of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis as an adult can be explained by levels of corticosterone, the avian glucocorticoid, the individual experienced as a nestling or even as an embryo via yolk exposure. Studies also suggest that perinatal exposure to corticosterone can have effects upon avian `personalities' or coping styles, and findings from mammalian studies suggest that these long-term effects are mediated epigenetically via altered expression of relevant DNA sequences. Although a consistent pattern across-species has yet to emerge, recent work in Florida scrub-jays Aphelocoma coerulescens found that baseline corticosterone levels in 11-day-old nestlings explained 84\% of the variation in `personality' (bold vs. timid) when those individuals were tested approximately seven months later. Nestlings with elevated corticosterone levels were more timid than those individuals that as nestlings experienced relatively low corticosterone levels. Some researchers have suggested that parents might use such mechanisms to `program' their offsprings' phenotype to best fit prevailing environmental conditions. This review will visit what is known about the links between stressful developmental conditions that result in exposure to elevated corticosterone and the short- and long-term effects of this steroid hormone upon central nervous system function and whether alterations thereof are beneficial, deleterious, or neutral. It will concentrate on examples from birds, although critical supporting studies from the mammalian literature will be included as appropriate [Current Zoology 57 (4): 514--530, 2011].},

	abstract = {Ecological and medical researchers are investing great effort to determine the role of Maternally-Derived Stress (MDS) as an inducer of phenotypic plasticity in offspring. Many researchers have interpreted phenotypic responses as unavoidable negative outcomes (e.g., small birth weight, high anxiety); however, a biased underestimate of the adaptive potential of MDS-induced effects is possible if they are not viewed within an ecologically relevant or a life-history optimization framework. We review the ecological and environmental drivers of MDS, how MDS signals are transferred to offspring, and what responses MDS induces. Results from four free-living vertebrate systems reveals that although MDS induces seemingly negative investment trade-offs in offspring, these phenotypic adjustments can be adaptive if they better match the offspring to future environments; however, responses can prove maladaptive if they unreliably predict (i.e., are mismatched to) future environments. Furthermore, MDS-induced adjustments that may prove maladaptive for individual offspring can still prove adaptive to mothers by reducing current reproductive investment, and benefitting lifetime reproductive success. We suggest that to properly determine the adaptive potential of MDS, researchers must take a broader integrated life-history perspective, appreciate both the immediate and longer term environmental context, and examine lifetime offspring and maternal fitness.},

	abstract = {Maternal effects may be a major factor influencing the demography of populations. In mammals, the transmission of stress hormones between mother and offspring may play an important role in these effects. Laboratory studies have shown that stressors during pregnancy and lactation result in lifelong programming of the offspring phenotype. However, the relevance of these studies to free-living mammals is unclear. The 10-year snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) cycle is intimately linked to fluctuating predation pressure and predation risk. The enigma of these cycles is the lack of population growth following the decline phase, when the predators have virtually all disappeared and the food supply is ample. We have shown that a predator-induced increase in maternal stress hormone levels resulted in a decline in reproduction. Here we examine population and hormone changes over a four-year period from the increase (2005) to the decline (2008). We report (1) that an index of maternal stress (fecal corticosteroid metabolite [FCM] concentrations) fluctuates in synchrony with predator density during the breeding season; (2) that maternal FCM levels are echoed in their offspring, and this occurs at a population-wide level; and (3) that higher maternal FCM levels at birth are correlated with an increased responsiveness of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in their progeny. Our results show an intergenerational inheritance of stress hormones in a free-ranging population of mammals. We propose that the lack of recovery of reproductive rates during the early low phase of the hare cycle may be the result of the impacts of intergenerational, maternally inherited stress hormones caused by high predation risk during the decline phase.},

	abstract = {Age-related cognitive decline is one of the major aspects that impede successful aging in humans. Environmental factors, such as chronic stress, can accelerate or aggravate cognitive deficits during aging. While there is abundant evidence that chronic stress directly affects cognitive performance, the lasting consequences of stress exposures during vulnerable developmental time windows are largely unknown. This is especially true for the adolescent period, which is critical in terms of physical, sexual, and behavioral maturation. Here we used chronic social stress during adolescence in male mice and investigated the consequences of this treatment on cognitive performance during aging. We observed a substantial impairment of spatial memory, but not other memory domains, 12 months after the end of the stress period. This hippocampus-dependent cognitive dysfunction was supported by concomitant impairment in LTP induction in CA1 neurons in 15-month-old animals. Further, we observed a decrease of hippocampal BDNF mRNA and synaptophysin immunoreactivity, suggesting plasticity and structural alterations in formerly stressed mice. Finally, we identified expression changes of specific neurotransmitter subunits critically involved in learning and memory, specifically the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B. Taken together, our results identify possible molecular mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment during aging, demonstrating the detrimental impact of stress during adolescence on hippocampus-dependent cognitive function in aged mice.

	abstract = {Abstract
            The stress phenotype is multivariate. Recent advances have broadened our understanding beyond characterizing the stress response in a single dimension. Simultaneously, the toolbox available to ecophysiologists has expanded greatly in recent years, allowing the measurement of multiple biomarkers from an individual at a single point in time. Yet these advances---in our conceptual understanding and available methodologies---have not yet been combined in a unifying multivariate statistical framework. Here, we offer a brief review of the multivariate stress phenotype and describe a general statistical approach for analysis using nonparametric multivariate analysis of variance with residual randomization in permutation procedures (RRPP) implemented using the ``RRPP'' package in R. We also provide an example illustrating the novel insights that can be gained from a holistic multivariate approach to stress and provide a tutorial for how we analyzed these data, including annotated R code and a guide to interpretation of outputs (Online Appendix 1). We hope that this statistical methodology will provide a quantitative framework facilitating the unification of our theoretical understanding and empirical observations into a quantitative, multivariate theory of stress.},

We report the first experimental demonstration of indirect predator effects on the annual {\^O}birth{\~O} rate resulting from negative effects on the size of subsequent clutches laid by birds. We manipulated the probability of nest predation and measured the size of subsequent clutches and multiple indices of the mother{\~O}s physiological condition, while controlling for food availability, date and stage of breeding. Females subject to frequent experimental nest predation laid smaller subsequent clutches and were in poorer physiological condition, particularly regarding non-resource-based indices (e.g. oxidative stress and glucocorticoid mobilization) consistent with both a response to the threat of predation and an increased cost of egg production.},

@article{warner_corticosterone_2009,
	abstract = {Stress experienced by a reproducing female can substantially affect the morphology, behavior, and physiology (and hence fitness) of her offspring. In addition, recent studies demonstrate that stress hormones (corticosterone) influence sex determination of embryos. To explore these issues, we manipulated corticosterone levels in eggs of two Australian lizard species (Amphibolurus muricatus and Bassiana duperreyi) that exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Elevated corticosterone levels during embryonic development affected body size, growth rates, and sex ratios of the resultant offspring, but the direction and magnitude of these effects differed between the species. Corticosterone enhanced growth rates of hatchling B. duperreyi but inhibited growth of A. muricatus. Eggs with elevated levels of corticosterone produced more daughters in A. muricatus and more sons in B. duperreyi. The sex-ratio effect in A. muricatus may have been due to sex-specific embryonic mortality, but it may represent a direct effect on sex determination in B. duperreyi (because embryonic mortality was not affected by corticosterone manipulation in this species). These results demonstrate the complexity of proximate mechanisms for sex determination among reptiles with TSD and illustrate the potential role of corticosterone in sex-determining systems.},

	abstract = {Maternal distress during pregnancy increases plasma levels of cortisol and corticotrophin releasing hormone in the mother and foetus. These may contribute to insulin resistance and behaviour disorders in their offspring that include attention and learning deficits, generalized anxiety and depression. The changes in behaviour, with or independent of alterations in the function of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, can be induced by prenatal stress in laboratory rodents and non-human primates. The appearance of such changes depends on the timing of the maternal stress, its intensity and duration, gender of the offspring and is associated with structural changes in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, amygdala and nucleus accumbens. The dysregulation of the HPA axis and behaviour changes can be prevented by maternal adrenalectomy. However, only the increased anxiety and alterations in HPA axis are re-instated by maternal injection of corticosterone. Conclusion: Excess circulating maternal stress hormones alter the programming of foetal neurons, and together with genetic factors, the postnatal environment and quality of maternal attention, determine the behaviour of the offspring.},

This process with its persistent organizational effects has been called `programming'. The brain is a key target for such effects. This review focuses on the effects of adverse early environments, notably exposure to stress or glucocorticoids, upon subsequent adult hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, behaviour and cognition. We discuss the effects observed, the proposed underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms and the consequences for pathophysiology. The data suggest that key targets for programming include glucocorticoid receptor gene expression and the corticotrophin-releasing hormone system. Increasing evidence for analogous processes in humans is also reviewed. Early life programming of neuroendocrine systems and behaviour by stress and exogenous or endogenous glucocorticoids appears to be a fundamental process underpinning common disorders. Approaches to minimize or reverse the consequences of such early life events may have therapeutic importance.},

	abstract = {All organisms respond to environmental cues that allow them to organize the timing and duration of life history stages that make up their life cycles. Superimposed on this predictable life cycle are unpredictable events that have the potential to be stressful. Environmental and social stresses have deleterious effects on life history stages such as migration, reproductive function and molt in vertebrates. Global climate change, human disturbance and endocrine disruption from pollutants are increasingly likely to pose additional stresses that could have a major impact on organisms. Such impacts have great relevance to conservation as well as basic biology. Although some populations of vertebrates temporarily resist environmental and social stresses, and breed successfully, many show varying decrees of failure sometimes resulting in marked population decline. Alternatively, many aspects of global change may not be overtly stressful but timing of life history events becomes out of step with phenology because pertinent environmental signals normally used have been changed. There is much we do not know about how organisms respond to their natural environment, particularly how salient signals are perceived and then transduced into neuroendocrine and endocrine secretions. Comparative endocrinology has a key role to play in resolving mechanisms underlying responses to the environment. In the face of increasing human disturbance and global climate change there is an urgent need for more integration of ecological, evolutionary and mechanistic studies on stress biology of organisms in their natural world.},

@article{casagrande_increased_2020,
	abstract = {Telomeres are DNA structures that protect chromosome ends. However, telomeres shorten during cell replication and at critically low lengths can reduce cell replicative potential, induce cell senescence and decrease fitness. Stress exposure, which elevates glucocorticoid hormone concentrations, can exacerbate telomere attrition. This phenomenon has been attributed to increased oxidative stress generated by glucocorticoids (`oxidative stress hypothesis'). We recently suggested that glucocorticoids could increase telomere attrition during stressful periods by reducing the resources available for telomere maintenance through changes in the metabolic machinery (`metabolic telomere attrition hypothesis'). Here, we tested whether experimental increases in glucocorticoid levels affected telomere length and mitochondrial function in wild great tit (Parus major) nestlings during the energy-demanding early growth period. We monitored resulting corticosterone (Cort) concentrations in plasma and red blood cells, telomere lengths and mitochondrial metabolism (metabolic rate, proton leak, oxidative phosphorylation, maximal mitochondrial capacity and mitochondrial inefficiency). We assessed oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolites as well as the total non-enzymatic antioxidant protection in plasma. Compared with control nestlings, Cortnestlings had higher baseline corticosterone, shorter telomeres and higher mitochondrial metabolic rate. Importantly, Cort-nestlings showed increased mitochondrial proton leak, leading to a decreased ATP production efficiency. Treatment groups did not differ in oxidative damage or antioxidants. Hence, glucocorticoid-induced telomere attrition is associated with changes in mitochondrial metabolism, but not with ROS production. These findings support the hypothesis that shortening of telomere length during stressful periods is mediated by glucocorticoids through metabolic rearrangements.},

The physio- logical mechanisms that modulate such effects remain a matter of intense debate. Here, we test the role of the developmental environment in shaping adult mitochondrial function and link mitochond1ial function to expression of a sexually selected trait in males (bird song). We exposed male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) to corticosterone (CORT) treatment during development. After males reached adulthood, we quantified mito- chondrial function from whole red blood cells and measured baseline CORT and testosterone levels, body con- dition/composition, and song structure. CORT-treated males had mitochondria that were less efficient (FCRuR) and used a lower proportion of maximum capacity (FCRRJErs) than control males. Additionally, CORT-treated males had higher baseline levels of CORT as adults compared to control males. Using structural equation modelling, we found that the effects of CORT treatment during development on adult mitochondrial function were indirect and modulated by baseline CORT levels, which are programmed by CORT treatment during development. Developmental treatment also had an indirect effect on song peak frequency. Males treated with CORT during development sang songs with higher peak frequency than control males, bur this effect was modulated through increased CORT levels and by a decrease in FCRRJETS· CORT-treated males had smaller tarsi compared to conu-ol males; however, there were no associations between body size and measures of song fre- quency. Here, we provide the first evidence supporting links between the developmental environment, mito- chondrial function, and the expression of a sexually selected trait (bird song).},

@article{du_dynamic_2009,
	abstract = {Glucocorticoids play an important biphasic role in modulating neural plasticity; low doses enhance neural plasticity and spatial memory behavior, whereas chronic, higher doses produce inhibition. We found that 3 independent measures of mitochondrial function---mitochondrial oxidation, membrane potential, and mitochondrial calcium holding capacity---were regulated by long-term corticosterone (CORT) treatment in an inverted ``U''-shape. This regulation of mitochondrial function by CORT correlated with neuroprotection; that is, treatment with low doses of CORT had a neuroprotective effect, whereas treatment with high doses of CORT enhanced kainic acid (KA)-induced toxicity of cortical neurons. We then undertook experiments to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these biphasic effects and found that glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) formed a complex with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in response to CORT treatment and translocated with Bcl-2 into mitochondria after acute treatment with low or high doses of CORT in primary cortical neurons. However, after 3 days of treatment, high, but not low, doses of CORT resulted in decreased GR and Bcl-2 levels in mitochondria. As with the in vitro studies, Bcl-2 levels in the mitochondria of the prefrontal cortex were significantly decreased, along with GR levels, after long-term treatment with high-dose CORT in vivo. These findings have the potential to contribute to a more complete understanding of the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids and chronic stress regulate cellular plasticity and resilience and to inform the future development of improved therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Release of glucocorticoids (GCs) enables organisms to meet energy requirements during stressful situations by regulating intermediary metabolism. In the absence of compensatory mechanisms, increased metabolic activity (e.g., protein catabolism, lipolysis, and gluconeogenesis) should translate to increases in whole animal metabolism, and therefore energy expenditures, by organisms. However, to our knowledge, no study has estimated the total energy cost of elevated plasma GCs in any organism. Here we evaluated the effect of exogenous corticosterone (CORT) on metabolism in captive western fence lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis) by conducting two experiments. In experiment I we determined the dynamics of plasma CORT concentrations resulting from CORT injections. In experiment II we frequently measured changes in respiration for 24 h before and after CORT injection. Injection of 0.025 lg/g (low CORT) and 0.40 lg/ g CORT (high CORT) produced up to 26-fold increases in plasma CORT in lizards 3 h following injection compared to baseline levels. Plasma CORT concentrations returned to baseline levels 6 h after injection. CORT increased metabolism in both low and high CORT lizards (up to 121\% and 245\%, respectively) during the first 7.5 h after CORT injections compared to pre-treatment trials. Respiration returned to baseline rates 7.5 h after CORT administration. A surprising finding was that although high CORT males achieved higher plasma CORT concentrations than high CORT females, the metabolic response of high CORT females was 30\% greater than high CORT males. Our results suggest that GC-induced changes in respiration may be important for understanding the overall energetic implications of stress.},

@article{haussmann_embryonic_2012,
	abstract = {Early embryonic exposure to maternal glucocorticoids can broadly impact physiology and behaviour across phylogenetically diverse taxa. The transfer of maternal glucocorticoids to offspring may be an inevitable cost associated with poor environmental conditions, or serve as a maternal effect that alters offspring phenotype in preparation for a stressful environment. Regardless, maternal glucocorticoids are likely to have both costs and benefits that are paid and collected over different developmental time periods. We manipulated yolk corticosterone (cort) in domestic chickens (
              Gallus domesticus
              ) to examine the potential impacts of embryonic exposure to maternal stress on the juvenile stress response and cellular ageing. Here, we report that juveniles exposed to experimentally increased cort
              in ovo
              had a protracted decline in cort during the recovery phase of the stress response. All birds, regardless of treatment group, shifted to oxidative stress during an acute stress response. In addition, embryonic exposure to cort resulted in higher levels of reactive oxygen metabolites and an over-representation of short telomeres compared with the control birds. In many species, individuals with higher levels of oxidative stress and shorter telomeres have the poorest survival prospects. Given this, long-term costs of glucocorticoid-induced phenotypes may include accelerated ageing and increased mortality.},

	abstract = {Glucocorticoid (GC) levels vary with environmental conditions, but the functional interpretation of GC variation remains contentious. A primary function is thought to be metabolic, mobilizing body reserves to match energetic demands. This view is supported by temperaturedependent GC levels, although reports of this effect show unexplained heterogeneity. We hypothesized that the temperature effect on GC concentrations will depend on food availability through its effect on the energy spent to gather the food needed for thermoregulation. We tested this hypothesis in zebra finches living in outdoor aviaries with manipulated foraging conditions (i.e. easy versus hard), by relating within-individual differences in baseline GCs between consecutive years to differences in ambient temperature. In agreement with our hypothesis, we found the GC--temperature association to be significantly steeper in the hard foraging environment. This supports the metabolic explanation of GC variation, underlining the importance of accounting for variation in energy expenditure when interpreting GC variation.},

@article{louvart_prenatal_2009,
	abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with marked alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) function. In rats, prenatal restraint stress (stress applied to pregnant mothers, PRS) is known to impact behavioral and neuroendocrine sensitivity to several kinds of mild stress in adulthood. We have recently shown that PRS also modifies behavioral responses after exposure to an intense footshock in a potential animal model of PTSD. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the long-term effects of an aversive procedure (footshock followed by 3 weekly situational reminders) on the corticosterone response to a novel stress (restraint stress, 140 days after the footshock) in adult female PRS rats. Our data extend previous results showing that PRS leads to a long-lasting increase in plasma corticosterone after restraint stress in adult male rats. Moreover, we demonstrate that 140 days after the intense footshock, female PRS rats have lower corticosterone levels 60 min after restraint stress, suggesting an increase in the negative feedback of the HPA axis. These results indicate that early stress may favor long-lasting modifications of the HPA axis subsequent to exposure to an intense stress in adulthood.},

@article{marasco_developmental_2013,
	abstract = {Across diverse vertebrate taxa, stressful environmental conditions during development can shape phenotypic trajectories of developing individuals, which, while adaptive in the short-term, may impair health and survival in adulthood. Regardless, the long-lasting benefits or costs of early life stress are likely to depend on the conditions experienced across differing stages of development. Here, we used the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) to experimentally manipulate exposure to stress hormones in developing individuals. We tested the hypothesis that interactions occurring between pre- and post-natal developmental periods can induce long-term shifts on the adult oxidant phenotype in non-breeding sexually mature individuals. We showed that early life stress can induce long-term alterations in the basal antioxidant defences. The magnitude of these effects depended upon the timing of glucocorticoid exposure and upon interactions between the pre- and post-natal stressful stimuli. We also found differences among tissues with stronger effects in the erythrocytes than in the brain in which the long-term effects of glucocorticoids on antioxidant biomarkers appeared to be region-specific. Recent experimental work has demonstrated that early life exposure to stress hormones can markedly reduce adult survival (Monaghan et al., 2012). Our results suggest that long-term shifts in basal antioxidant defences might be one of the potential mechanisms driving such accelerated ageing processes and that post-natal interventions during development may be a potential tool to shape the effects induced by pre-natally glucococorticoid-exposed phenotypes.},

@article{mcewen_brain_2012,
	abstract = {Stress is a state of the mind, involving both brain and body as well as their interactions; it differs among individuals and reflects not only major life events but also the conflicts and pressures of daily life that alter physiological systems to produce a chronic stress burden that, in turn, is a factor in the expression of disease. This burden reflects the impact of not only life experiences but also genetic variations and individual health behaviors such as diet, physical activity, sleep, and substance abuse; it also reflects stable epigenetic modifications in development that set lifelong patterns of physiological reactivity and behavior through biological embedding of early environments interacting with cumulative change from experiences over the lifespan. Hormones associated with the chronic stress burden protect the body in the short run and promote adaptation (allostasis), but in the long run, the burden of chronic stress causes changes in the brain and body that can lead to disease (allostatic load and overload). Brain circuits are plastic and remodeled by stress to change the balance between anxiety, mood control, memory, and decision making. Such changes may have adaptive value in particular contexts, but their persistence and lack of reversibility can be maladaptive. However, the capacity of brain plasticity to effects of stressful experiences in adult life has only begun to be explored along with the efficacy of top-down strategies for helping the brain change itself, sometimes aided by pharmaceutical agents and other treatments.},

Remarkably, the breeding partners of such exposed individuals also died at a younger age. This negative effect on partner longevity was the same for both sexes; it occurred irrespective of the partner's own early stress exposure and was in addition to any longevity reduction arising from this. Furthermore, this partner effect continued even after the breeding partnership was terminated. Only 5 per cent of control birds with control partners had died after 3 years, compared with over 40 per cent in early stress--early stress pairs. In contrast, reproductive capability appeared unaffected by the early stress treatment, even when breeding in stressful environmental circumstances. Our results clearly show that increased exposure to glucocorticoids early in life can markedly reduce adult life expectancy, and that pairing with such exposed partners carries an additional and substantial lifespan penalty.},

Nevertheless, the cellular mechanisms by which stressful life experiences and their associated primary neuroendocrine mediators cause biological damage and increase disease risk remain poorly understood. The allostatic load model of chronic stress focuses on glucocorticoid dysregulation. In this Perspectives, we expand upon the metabolic aspects of this model---particularly glucose imbalance---and propose that mitochondrial dysfunction constitutes an early, modifiable target of chronic stress and stress-related health behaviours. Central to this process is mitochondrial regulation of energy metabolism and cellular signalling. Chronically elevated glucose levels damage both mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA, generating toxic products that can promote systemic inflammation, alter gene expression and hasten cell ageing. Consequently, the concept of `mitochondrial allostatic load' defines the deleterious structural and functional changes that mitochondria undergo in response to elevated glucose levels and stress-related pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {Significance
            In humans and animals, stress triggers multisystemic physiological responses that vary in nature and magnitude. The organism's response to stress, rather than actual stressors, leads to allostatic load that predisposes to disease. This study in mice demonstrates that a specific cellular component that sustains life via energy transformation and intracellular signaling---the mitochondrion---influences the organism's integrated response to psychological stress. Each component of the stress response assessed was modified by at least one mitochondrial defect. When analyzed collectively, stress-induced neuroendocrine, inflammatory, metabolic, and transcriptional responses coalesced into unique signatures that distinguish groups based on their mitochondrial genotype. This work shows that mitochondria can regulate complex whole-body physiological responses, impacting stress perception at the cellular and organismal levels.

              The experience of psychological stress triggers neuroendocrine, inflammatory, metabolic, and transcriptional perturbations that ultimately predispose to disease. However, the subcellular determinants of this integrated, multisystemic stress response have not been defined. Central to stress adaptation is cellular energetics, involving mitochondrial energy production and oxidative stress. We therefore hypothesized that abnormal mitochondrial functions would differentially modulate the organism's multisystemic response to psychological stress. By mutating or deleting mitochondrial genes encoded in the mtDNA [NADH dehydrogenase 6 (
              ND6
              ) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (
              COI
              )] or nuclear DNA [adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (
              ANT1
              ) and nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (
              NNT
              )], we selectively impaired mitochondrial respiratory chain function, energy exchange, and mitochondrial redox balance in mice. The resulting impact on physiological reactivity and recovery from restraint stress were then characterized. We show that mitochondrial dysfunctions altered the hypothalamic--pituitary--adrenal axis, sympathetic adrenal--medullary activation and catecholamine levels, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, circulating metabolites, and hippocampal gene expression responses to stress. Each mitochondrial defect generated a distinct whole-body stress-response signature. These results demonstrate the role of mitochondrial energetics and redox balance as modulators of key pathophysiological perturbations previously linked to disease. This work establishes mitochondria as stress-response modulators, with implications for understanding the mechanisms of stress pathophysiology and mitochondrial diseases.},

To study the contribution of stress hormones towards stress-induced oxidative processes in the brain, we investigated the response of important free-radical scavenging enzymes toward chronic administration of two doses of corticosterone (low dose: 10 mg/kg/day, high dose: 40 mg/kg/day) in rodents. After a 21-day experimental period, a significant decline in both superoxide dismutase and catalase was observed in both stressed and stress hormone-treated animals. The brain levels of glutathione as well as the activities of glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione reductase were also significantly decreased, while lipid peroxidation levels were significantly increased in comparison to controls. A direct pro-oxidant effect of stress hormones in the brain during physical and psychological stress was observed, indicating important implications for oxidative stress as a major pathological mechanism during chronic stress and a consequent target option for anti-stress therapeutic interventions.},

@article{picard_energetic_2018,
	abstract = {Energy is required to sustain life and enable stress adaptation. At the cellular level, energy is largely derived from mitochondria -- unique multifunctional organelles with their own genome. Four main elements connect mitochondria to stress: (1) Energy is required at the molecular, (epi)genetic, cellular, organellar, and systemic levels to sustain components of stress responses; (2) Glucocorticoids and other steroid hormones are produced and metabolized by mitochondria; (3) Reciprocally, mitochondria respond to neuroendocrine and metabolic stress mediators; and (4) Experimentally manipulating mitochondrial functions alters physiological and behavioral responses to psychological stress. Thus, mitochondria are endocrine organelles that provide both the energy and signals that enable and direct stress adaptation. Neural circuits regulating social behavior -- as well as psychopathological processes -- are also influenced by mitochondrial energetics. An integrative view of stress as an energy-driven process opens new opportunities to study mechanisms of adaptation and regulation across the lifespan.},

Due to the relative ease of administrating detour tasks, the paradigm has lately been used in large-scale comparative studies in order to investigate the evolution of inhibitory control. Here we review the detour paradigm and some of its cognitive requirements, we identify various ecological and contextual factors that might affect detour performance, we also discuss developmental and neurological underpinnings of detour behaviors, and we suggest some methodological approaches to make species comparisons more robust.},

Inhibiting prepotent responses to resist the temptation of a stimulus in certain situations, such as a novel food item, can directly affect an animal's survival. In humans and dogs, response inhibition varies between contexts and between individuals. We used two contextually different experiments to investigate response inhibition in the eastern water skink (Eulamprus quoyii): reversal of a visual two-choice discrimination and a cylinder detour task. During the two-choice task, half of our lizards were able to reach an initial learning criterion, but, thereafter, did not show consistent performance. Only two individuals reached a more stringent criterion, but subsequently failed during reversals. Furthermore, half of our animals were not able to inhibit a pre-existing side preference which affected their ability to learn during the two-choice task. Skinks were, however, able to achieve a detour around a cylinder performing at levels comparable to brown lemurs, marmosets, and some parrot species. A comparison between the tasks showed that reaching the initial criterion was associated with low success during the detour task, indicating that response inhibition could be context-specific in the water skink. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine inhibitory control and motor self-regulation in a lizard species.},

Individuals and species differ in inhibitory control. Identifying what influences inhibitory control ability within and between species is key to understanding how it evolved. We compared performance in the cylinder task across five lizard species: tree skinks (Egernia striolata), gidgee skinks (Egernia stokesii), eastern blue-tongue skinks (Tiliqua s. scincoides), sleepy lizards (Tiliqua r. asper), and eastern water skinks (Eulamprus quoyii). In our task, animals had to inhibit the prepotent motor response of directly approaching a reward placed within a semi-transparent mesh cylinder and instead reach in through the side openings. Additionally, in three lizard species, we compared performance in the cylinder task to reversal learning to determine the task specificity of inhibitory ability. Within species, neither sex, origin, body condition, neophobia, nor pre-experience with other cognitive tests affected individual performance. Species differed in motor response inhibition: Blue-tongue skinks made fewer contacts with the semi-transparent cylinder wall than all other species. Blue-tongue skinks also had lower body condition than the other species which suggest motivation as the underlying cause for species differences in task performance. Moreover, we found no correlation between inhibitory ability across different experiments. This is the first study comparing cylinder task performance among lizard species. Given that inhibitory control is probably widespread in lizards, motor response inhibition as exercised in the cylinder task appears to have a long evolutionary history and is likely fundamental to survival and fitness.},

@article{burgess_temperature-induced_2011,
	abstract = {Maternal effects could influence the persistence of species under environmental change, but the adaptive significance of many empirically estimated maternal effects remains unclear. Inferences about the adaptive significance of maternal effects depend on the correlation between maternal and offspring environments, the relative importance of frequency- or density-dependent selection and whether absolute or relative fitness measures are used. Here, we combine the monitoring of the environment over time with a factorial experiment where we manipulated both the maternal and offspring environment in a marine bryozoan (Bugula neritina). We focused on temperature as our environmental variable as temperature commonly varies over short time scales in nature. We found that offspring from mothers kept in warmer water were smaller and more variable in size, but had increased dispersal potential and higher metamorphic success than offspring from mothers kept in cooler water. Our results suggest that, under frequency- or density-independent selection, mothers that experienced higher temperatures compared with lower temperatures were favoured. Under frequency- or density-dependent selection, there were indications that mothers that experienced higher temperatures would be favoured only if their offspring encountered similar (warmer) temperatures, though these results were not statistically significant. Analysis of time series data on temperature in the field shows that the maternal thermal environment is a good predictor of the temperatures offspring are likely to experience early in life. We suggest that future studies on maternal effects estimate environmental predictability and present both absolute and relative estimates of maternal fitness within each offspring environment.},

@article{crill_within_1996,
	abstract = {We investigated the effects of developmental and parental temperatures on several physiological and morphological traits of adult Drosophila melanogaster. Flies for the parental generation were raised at either low or moderate temperature (18$\,^{\circ}$C or 25$\,^{\circ}$C) and then mated in the four possible sex-by-parental temperature crosses. Their offspring were raised at either 18$\,^{\circ}$C or 25$\,^{\circ}$C and then scored as adults for morphological (dry body mass, wing size, and abdominal melanization [females only]), physiological (knock-down temperature, and thermal dependence of walking speed), and life history (egg size) traits. The experiment was replicated, and the factorial design allows us to determine whether and how paternal, maternal, and developmental temperatures (as well as offspring sex) influence the various traits. Sex and developmental temperature had major effects on all traits. Females had larger bodies and wings, higher knock-down temperatures, and slower speeds (but similar shaped performance curves) than males, Development at 2YC (versus at 18$\,^{\circ}$C) increased knock-down temperature, increased maximal speed and thermal performance breadth, decreased the optimal temperature for walking, decreased body mass and wing size, reduced abdominal melanization, and reduced egg size. Parental temperatures influenced a few traits, but the effects were generally small relative to those of sex or developmental temperature. Flies whose mother had been raised at 25$\,^{\circ}$C (versus at 18$\,^{\circ}$C) had slightly higher knock-down temperature and smaller body mass. Flies whose father had been raised at 25$\,^{\circ}$C had relatively longer wings. The effects of paternal, maternal, and developmental temperatures sometimes differed in direction. The existence of significant within- and between-generation effects suggests that comparative studies need to standardize thermal environments for at least two generations, that attempts to estimate "field" heritabilities may be unreliable for some traits, and that predictions of short-term evolutionary responses to selection will be difficult.},

	abstract = {The evolution of matrotrophy (i.e., direct supply of nutrients by the mother during gestation) may be associated with high maternal energy availability during gestation. However, we lack knowledge about the selective advantages of matrotrophic viviparity (live-bearing) in reptiles. In reptiles, the interaction between body temperature and food intake affect maternal net energy gain. In the present study, we examined the effects of basking and food availability (2 by 2 factorial design) during gestation on offspring phenotype in a matrotrophic viviparous lizard (Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii). Subsequently, we investigated if the maternal effects were context-dependent using offspring growth rate as an indicator of the adaptive significance of matrotrophy. Offspring were exposed either to the same thermal conditions as their mothers experienced or to thermal conditions different from those experienced by their mothers. We provide the first evidence that an interaction between maternal thermal and maternal food conditions during gestation strongly affects offspring phenotype, including date of birth, body size and performance ability, which affect offspring fitness. Offspring growth rate was dependent on offspring thermal conditions, but was not influenced by maternal effects or offspring sex. Matrotrophic viviparity provided gravid females with the means to enhance offspring fitness through greater energetic input to offspring when conditions allowed it (i.e., extended basking opportunity with high food availability). Therefore, we suggest that selective advantages of matrotrophic viviparity in P. entrecasteauxii may be associated with high maternal energy availability during gestation.},

@article{crews_temperature-dependent_1996,
	abstract = {Sex determination is the product of coordinated gene expression. Mutational analyses have yielded great progress in our understanding of mammalian sex determination, and insight into the evolution of this sex chromosome system would be valuable. Mammals arose from turtle-like reptiles, and in many turtles the incubation temperature of the egg determines the sex of the offspring, a process known as temperature-dependent sex determination. There is mounting evidence that sex steroid hormones are the physiological equivalent of incubation temperature and serve as the proximate trigger for male and female sex determination. Temperature appears to accomplish this end by acting on genes coding for steroidogenic enzymes and sex steroid hormone receptors. The ability to manipulate sex determination in turtles both by temperature and by sex steroid hormones extends our understanding of the evolution as well as the physiology and molecular biology of sex determination.},

@article{gilchrist_parental_2001,
	abstract = {We explored the extent to which a phenotypic trait (walking speed) of Drosophila melanogaster is influenced by population, developmental temperature, adult temperature, and age. Our goals were to estimate the importance of these factors and to test the beneficial acclimation hypothesis. We measured speed of flies from two populations (the Congo and France) that developed at different temperatures (18, 25, and 29ЊC) and were tested at different temperatures (18, 25, and 29ЊC) and ages (2, 7, 13 days). Not surprisingly, speed increased strongly with test temperature. Speed was generally greatest for flies reared at an intermediate developmental temperature, contrary to the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, which predicts that speed would be greatest when influenced by interactions involving population. For example, speed was greatest for flies from France that developed at a low temperature, but for flies from the Congo that developed at a high temperature. The impact of developmental temperature declined with age. Surprisingly, speed actually increased with age for flies raised and maintained at a low temperature, but decreased with age for flies raised and maintained at an intermediate or at a high temperature. Thus, walking performance is highly dynamic phenotypically, complicating potential attempts to predict responses to selection on performance.},

            In the ongoing discussion about brain evolution in vertebrates, the main interest has shifted from theories focusing on energy balance to theories proposing social or ecological benefits of enhanced intellect. With the availability of a wealth of new data on basal metabolic rate (BMR) and brain size and with the aid of reliable techniques of comparative analysis, we are able to show that in fact energetics is an issue in the maintenance of a relatively large brain, and that brain size is positively correlated with the BMR in mammals, controlling for body size effects. We conclude that attempts to explain brain size variation in different taxa must consider the ability to sustain the energy costs alongside cognitive benefits.},

@article{szabo_learning_2021,
	abstract = {Recently, there has been a surge in cognition research using non-avian reptile systems. As a diverse group of animals, non-avian reptiles [turtles, the tuatara, crocodylians, and squamates (lizards, snakes and amphisbaenids)] are good model systems for answering questions related to cognitive ecology, from the role of the environment on the brain, behaviour and learning, to how social and life-history factors correlate with learning ability. Furthermore, given their variable social structure and degree of sociality, studies on reptiles have shown that group living is not a pre-condition for social learning. Past research has demonstrated that non-avian reptiles are capable of more than just instinctive reactions and basic cognition. Despite their ability to provide answers to fundamental questions in cognitive ecology, and a growing literature, there have been no recent systematic syntheses of research in this group. Here, we systematically, and comprehensively review studies on reptile learning. We identify 92 new studies investigating learning in reptiles not included in previous reviews on this topic -- affording a unique opportunity to provide a more in-depth synthesis of existing work, its taxonomic distribution, the types of cognitive domains tested and methodologies that have been used. Our review therefore provides a major update on our current state of knowledge and ties the collective evidence together under nine umbrella research areas: (i) habituation of behaviour, (ii) animal training through conditioning, (iii) avoiding aversive stimuli, (iv) spatial learning and memory, (v) learning during foraging, (vi) quality and quantity discrimination, (vii) responding to change, (viii) solving novel problems, and (ix) social learning. Importantly, we identify knowledge gaps and propose themes which offer important future research opportunities including how cognitive ability might influence fitness and survival, testing cognition in ecologically relevant situations, comparing cognition in invasive and non-invasive populations of species, and social learning. To move the field forward, it will be immensely important to build upon the descriptive approach of testing whether a species can learn a task with experimental studies elucidating causal reasons for cognitive variation within and among species. With the appropriate methodology, this young but rapidly growing field of research should advance greatly in the coming years providing significant opportunities for addressing general questions in cognitive ecology and beyond.},

@article{alvarez-quintero_long-lasting_2020,
	abstract = {Early environment often has profound effects on phenotypic development that last throughout the lifetime. It has been suggested that unpredictable environments may favor cognitive abilities. However, cognitive challenges during development may result in life-history trade-offs, because complex neural reorganization required for coping with these challenges entails stress and energy costs. In this study, we experimentally tested whether early exposure to different cognitive challenges influences cognitive ability, brain size and life-history traits in the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). For this, juvenile sticklebacks were challenged over a 2-month period to resolve four different learning tasks. Contrary to our predictions, individuals trained in learning tasks later showed a reduced ability to solve a new maze task, suggesting that these learning tasks during early life may impair the ability to cope with new cognitive challenges. Females from the learning task group showed smaller optic tectum volume than the control females. Fish from the learning task treatment reduced their growth during the experiment, then accelerated growth to catch up until the breeding season. Sticklebacks reared in an environment with learning tasks also suffered a greater mortality than the controls both during and after the experiment. For the first time to our knowledge, we demonstrated direct costs of living in environments with cognitive challenges by tracking long-term performances of sticklebacks exposed to dynamic challenges during early life. Our results show that environmental challenges during ontogeny trigger plastic responses, but contrary to the common belief, do not improve the ability to cope with new cognitive challenges.},

	abstract = {The need to locate distributed resources such as mates, food, and nests is correlated with an enlarged hippocampus in many mammalian and avian species. This correlation is believed to be a consequence of selection for spatial ability. Little is known about how such ecological needs affect non-mammalian, non-avian species. In lizards, the putative hippocampal homologues are the dorsal cortex (DC) and medial cortex (MC). We examined the relationship between foraging ecology and the size of the DC and MC in congeneric male lizards. We predicted based on the mammalian and avian literature that \textit{Acanthodactylus boskianus,} an active forager that captures clumped, immobile prey would have a larger MC and DC than \textit{A. scutellatus,} a sit-and-wait predator, that captures mobile prey. Our previous behavioral studies showed that\textit{ A. boskianus} did not differ from \textit{A. scutellatus} on a spatial task but that \textit{A. boskianus} was significantly better at the reversal of a visual discrimination, another task that is hippocampally dependent in mammals. In the current study, we found that, relative to telencephalon volume, the MC and DC were larger in the active forager whereas a control region, the lateral, olfactory, cortex, was similar in size between species. The current anatomical results suggest that MC and DC size is related to active foraging in lizards and, along with our previous behavioral studies, show that it is possible for this relationship to occur in the absence of evidence for species differences in spatial memory.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract  This review focuses on five key evolutionary issues pertaining to animal cognition, defined as the neuronal processes concerned with the acquisition, retention, and use of information. Whereas the use of information, or decision making, has been relatively well examined by students of behavior, evolutionary aspects of other cognitive traits that affect behavior, including perception, learning, memory, and attention, are less well understood. First, there is ample evidence for genetically based individual variation in cognitive traits, although much of the information for some traits comes from humans. Second, several studies documented positive association between cognitive abilities and performance measures linked to fitness. Third, information on the evolution of cognitive traits is available primarily for color vision and decision making. Fourth, much of the data on plasticity of cognitive traits appears to reflect nonadaptive phenotypic plasticity, perhaps because few evolutionary analyses of cognitive plasticity have been carried out. Nonetheless, several studies suggest that cognitive traits show adaptive plasticity, and at least one study documented genetically based individual variation in plasticity. Fifth, whereas assertions that cognition has played a central role in animal evolution are not supported by currently available data, theoretical considerations indicate that cognition may either increase or decrease the rate of evolutionary change.},

In the current study, investigators used a modified shaping procedure involving successive approximations to train wild Burmese pythons (Python molurus bivitattus) to approach and depress an illuminated push button in order to gain access to a food reward. Results show that these large, wild snakes can be trained to accept extremely small food items, associate a stimulus with such rewards via operant conditioning and perform a contingent operant response to gain access to a food reward. The shaping procedure produced robust responses and provides a mechanism for investigating complex behavioral phenomena in massive snakes that are rarely studied in learning research.},

Here I present a procedure suitable for testing spatial cognition that exploits a naturally evolved, ethologically relevant ability common to many lizards (i.e. refuge seeking behavior). The procedure requires lizards to learn the location of an open refuge inside a rectangular arena containing artificial refuges in every corner, using distal extramaze visual cues and with no local cues marking the location of the open refuge. The procedure probes the lizards' place learning ability and effectively rules out the use of egocentric and response-based strategies. The described procedure was successfully used to demonstrate place learning in a lacertid lizard (Podarcis liolepis). Over the course of two weeks of training both the latency to entering the open refuge and the number of corners visited in each trial decreased gradually, indicating that learning had taken place in over 60\% of the lizards tested. These results confirm that, under certain circumstances, lizards are capable of navigating to a goal using a place learning strategy.},

	abstract = {There is mounting evidence that social learning is not just restricted to group-living animals, but also occurs in species with a wide range of social systems. However, we still have a poor understanding of the factors driving individual differences in social information use. We investigated the effects of relative dominance on social information use in the eastern water skink (Eulamprus quoyii), a species with age-dependent social learning. We used staged contests to establish dominant--subordinate relationships in pairs of lizards and tested whether observers use social information to more quickly solve both an association and reversal learning task in situations where the demonstrator was either dominant or subordinate. Surprisingly, we found no evidence of social information use, irrespective of relative dominance between observer and demonstrator. However, dominant lizards learnt at a faster rate than subordinate lizards in the associative learning task, although there were no significant differences in the reversal task. In light of previous work in this species, we suggest that age may be a more important driver of social information use because demonstrators and observers in our study were closely size-matched and were likely to be of similar age.},

Of the few previous studies testing for spatial memory in squamates, some have found no evidence of spatial memory while two studies have found evidence of spatial memory in snakes, but have been criticized based on methodological issues. We used the Barnes maze, a common paradigm to test spatial memory abilities in mammals, to test for spatial memory abilities in the side-blotched lizard (

Animals in spatially impoverished environments have decreased hippocampal attributes. However, we do not know if differences in the spatial environment differentially interact with territorial status, which also covaries with hippocampal attributes. Here, we asked whether territoriality and differential spatial-area use interact to generate different effects on cortical attributes (reptilian hippocampal homologue) in lizards. We compared medial and dorsal cortical attributes between territorial and nonterritorial morphotypes of side-blotched lizards, Uta stansburiana, in larger versus smaller (i.e., spatially impoverished) enclosures. We found that territorial males had increased neurogenesis rates in their medial cortices in larger enclosures when compared with their siblings in smaller enclosures; nonterritorial males had low levels of neurogenesis regardless of enclosure size. Enclosure size had no significant effect on cortical volumes or the total number of neurons in either cortical region. These results suggest that territorial morphotypes may be more sensitive to changes in the spatial environment, thus leading to increases in regulation of neurogenesis in the face of increased spatial processing and physical activity demands.},

@article{roth_variation_2012,
	abstract = {Selection for enhanced cognitive traits is hypothesized to produce enhancements to brain structures that support those traits. Although numerous studies suggest that this pattern is robust, there are several mechanisms that may produce this association. First, cognitive traits and their neural underpinnings may be fixed as a result of differential selection on cognitive function within specific environments. Second, these relationships may be the product of the selection for plasticity, where differences are produced owing to an individual's experiences in the environment. Alternatively, the relationship may be a complex function of experience, genetics and/or epigenetic effects. Using a well-studied model species (black-capped chickadee,
              Poecile atricapillus
              ), we have for the first time, to our knowledge, addressed these hypotheses. We found that differences in hippocampal (Hp) neuron number, neurogenesis and spatial memory previously observed in wild chickadees persisted in hand-raised birds from the same populations, even when birds were raised in an identical environment. These findings reject the hypothesis that variation in these traits is owing solely to differences in memory-based experiences in different environments. Moreover, neuron number and neurogenesis were strikingly similar between captive-raised and wild birds from the same populations, further supporting the genetic hypothesis. Hp volume, however, did not differ between the captive-raised populations, yet was very different in their wild counterparts, supporting the experience hypothesis. Our results indicate that the production of some Hp factors may be inherited and largely independent of environmental experiences in adult life, regardless of their magnitude, in animals under high selection pressure for memory, while traits such as volume may be more plastic and modified by the environment.},

	abstract = {Personality traits, defined as differences in the behavior of individual animals of the same species that are consistent over time and context, such as `boldness,' have been shown to be both heritable and be influenced by external factors, such as predation pressure. Currently, we know very little about the role that early environmental factors have upon personality. Thus, we investigated the impact of incubation temperature upon the boldness on an oviparous reptile, the bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps). Eggs, from one clutch, were incubated at two different average temperatures within the normal range. After hatching the lizards were raised under the same environmental conditions. Novel object and novel environment tests were used to assess personality. Each test was repeated in both the short term and the long term. The results revealed that incubation temperature did impact upon `boldness' but only in the short term and suggests that, rather than influencing personality, incubation temperature may have an effect on the development of behavioral of oviparous reptiles at different stages across ontogeny.},

However, there are situations in which learning in isolation-reared rats is enhanced or unimpaired compared to socially reared rats. The present experiments investigated the effects of isolation rearing on place navigation in the Morris water maze. Two complementary paradigms were studied: isolation and socially reared rats were exposed to the water maze either without drug pretreatment or following systemic administration of scopolamine. Two conditions were examined: place learning and reversal learning. Male Lister hooded rats were either housed singly (isolation reared) or in groups of four (social reared) from weaning at 21 days of age. Six weeks later place learning and reversal learning were determined using the Morris water maze. The time taken to locate the submerged island (escape latency) was used as the measure of learning ability.},

@article{leal_behavioural_2012,
	abstract = {The role of behavioural flexibility in responding to new or changing environmental challenges is a central theme in cognitive ecology. Studies of behavioural flexibility have focused mostly on mammals and birds because theory predicts that behavioural flexibility is favoured in species or clades that exploit a diversity of habitats or food sources and/or have complex social structure, attributes not associated with ectothermic vertebrates. Here, we present the results of a series of experiments designed to test cognitive abilities across multiple cognitive modules in a tropical arboreal lizard:
              Anolis evermanni
              . This lizard shows behavioural flexibility across multiple cognitive tasks, including solving a novel motor task using multiple strategies and reversal learning, as well as rapid associative learning. This flexibility was unexpected because lizards are commonly believed to have limited cognitive abilities and highly stereotyped behaviour. Our findings indicate that the cognitive abilities of
              A. evermanni
              are comparable with those of some endothermic species that are recognized to be highly flexible, and strongly suggest a re-thinking of our understanding of the cognitive abilities of ectothermic tetrapods and of the factors favouring the evolution of behavioural flexibility.},

Robust evidence suggests that innovation rate and its neural correlates allow birds and mammals to cope better with environmental change.

@article{amat_incubating_2017,
	abstract = {Studies of risk-taking by breeding birds have frequently addressed the effect of brood value on the decisions taken by incubating birds when predators approach their nests. However, leaving eggs unattended during predator disturbance may expose embryos to other potentially harmful factors, to which parent birds should respond when making decisions about when to leave or return to their nest. In this study, we show that diurnal changes in flushing behaviour of incubating terns from nests during predator approach were affected by egg camouflage, the terns allowing a closer approach to individual nests when the eggs appeared better camouflaged. Return times to the nests were affected by ambient temperature, with the terns shortening such times at high ambient temperatures, thus diminishing the risk of egg overheating. As a whole, our results show that the decisions of the birds on when to leave or return to their nests depended on shifting payoffs, as a consequence of diurnal variations in both the thermal risks incurred by embryos and egg crypsis. Environmental costs of risk-taking, such as those considered here, should be addressed in studies of risk-taking by breeding birds.},

Empirical evidence shows that environment (encompassing all external influences on the genome) can impose transgenerational effects and generate heritable variation for a broad array of traits in animals, plants, and other organisms. Such effects can be mediated by the transmission of epigenetic, cytoplasmic, somatic, nutritional, environmental, and behavioral variation. Building on the work of many authors, we outline a general framework for conceptualizing nongenetic inheritance and its evolutionary implications. This framework shows that, by decoupling phenotypic change from the genotype, nongenetic inheritance can circumvent the limitations of genetic inheritance and thereby influence population dynamics and alter the fitness landscape. The weight of theory and empirical evidence indicates that nongenetic inheritance is a potent factor in evolution that can engender outcomes unanticipated under the Mendelian-genetic model.},

Moreover, recent studies indicate that epigenetic variation in natural populations can be independent from genetic variation, and that in some cases environmentally induced epigenetic changes may be inherited by future generations. These novel findings are potentially highly relevant to ecologists because they could significantly improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying natural phenotypic variation and the responses of organisms to environmental change. To understand the full significance of epigenetic processes, however, it is imperative to study them in an ecological context. Ecologists should therefore start using a combination of experimental approaches borrowed from ecological genetics, novel techniques to analyse and manipulate epigenetic variation, and genomic tools, to investigate the extent and structure of epigenetic variation within and among natural populations, as well as the interrelations between epigenetic variation, phenotypic variation and ecological interactions.},

However, striking data, largely from the biomedical literature, show that environmental effects experienced even before conception can be transmissible to subsequent generations. Here, we review the growing evidence from natural systems for these cross-generational effects of early life conditions, showing that they can be generated by diverse environmental stressors, affect offspring in many ways and can be transmitted directly or indirectly by both parental lines for several generations. In doing so, we emphasize why early life might be so sensitive to the transmission of environmentally induced effects across generations. We also summarize recent theoretical advancements within the field of developmental plasticity, and discuss how parents might assemble different `internal' and `external' cues, even from the earliest stages of life, to instruct their investment decisions in offspring. In doing so, we provide a preliminary framework within the context of adaptive plasticity for understanding inter-generational phenomena that arise from early life conditions.},

For the past century, inheritance has been conceptualized almost exclusively as the transmission of DNA sequence variation from parents to offspring in accordance with Mendelian rules, but advances in cell and developmental biology have now revealed a rich array of inheritance mechanisms. This empirical evidence calls for a unified conception of inheritance that combines genetic and nongenetic mechanisms and encompasses the known range of transgenerational effects, including the transmission of genetic and epigenetic variation, the transmission of plastic phenotypes (acquired traits), and the effects of parental environment and genotype on offspring phenotype. We propose a unified theoretical framework based on the Price equation that can be used to model evolution under an expanded inheritance concept that combines the effects of genetic and nongenetic inheritance. To illustrate the utility and generality of this framework, we show how it can be applied to a variety of scenarios, including nontransmissible environmental noise, maternal effects, indirect genetic effects, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, RNA-mediated inheritance, and cultural inheritance.},

@article{dugas_payoffs_2016,
	abstract = {Offspring quantity and quality are components of parental fitness that cannot be maximized simultaneously. When the benefits of investing in offspring quality decline, parents are expected to shift investment towards offspring quantity (other reproductive opportunities). Even when mothers retain complete control of resource allocation, offspring control whether to allocate investment to growth or development towards independence, and this shared control may generate parent--offspring conflict over the duration of care. We examined these predictions by, in a captive colony, experimentally removing tadpoles of the strawberry poison frog (Oophaga pumilio) from the mothers that provision them with trophic eggs throughout development. Tadpoles removed from their mothers were no less likely to survive to nutritional independence (i.e. through metamorphosis) than were those that remained with their mothers, but these offspring were smaller at metamorphosis and were less likely to survive to reach adult size, even though they were fed ad libitum. Tadpoles that remained with their mothers developed more slowly than those not receiving care, a pattern that might suggest that offspring extracted more care than was in mothers' best interests. However, the fitness returns of providing care increased with offspring development, suggesting that mothers would be best off continuing care until tadpoles initiated metamorphosis. Although the benefits of parental investment in offspring quality are often thought to asymptote at high levels, driving parent--offspring conflict over weaning, this assumption may not hold over natural ranges of investment, with selection on both parents and offspring favouring extended durations of parental care.},

	abstract = {Maternal effects influence the phenotype of offspring through non-genetic mechanisms, and thus are important components of individual life-histories and act as drivers of and/or constraints on phenotypic evolution. A maternal effect common in egg-laying vertebrates is provisioning of the yolk with carotenoids, organic pigments that often color sexual ornaments and are hypothesized to play positive and substantial physiological roles. In a recent study, yolks of great tit (Parus major) eggs were directly supplemented with carotenoids, and the effects on offspring fitness proxies measured (Marri and Richner in Oecologia 176:371--377, 2014a). Nestlings from supplemented broods were heavier early in development and more likely to fledge, but otherwise equivalent to control nestlings. The authors consider in detail the potential physiological mechanisms that might underlie this result, and here I expand on their Discussion by considering a non-exclusive explanation: that parents provided higher quality care to broods that received supplemental carotenoids. I discuss the general non-independence of pre- and post-hatching/parturition maternal effects when parents care for offspring, and then briefly review evidence that carotenoids specifically are tied to the intensity of avian begging displays. Finally, I detail how inclusive fitness opportunities and constraints shape the adaptive landscape in which maternal effects operate, highlighting both theoretical and applied concerns surrounding questions about the adaptiveness of maternal effects.},

@article{dunn_maternal_2009,
	abstract = {Maternal obesity and diet consumption during pregnancy have been linked to offspring adiposity, cardiovascular disease, and impaired glucose metabolism. Furthermore, nutrition during development is clearly linked to somatic growth. However, few studies have examined whether phenotypes derived from maternal high-fat diet exposure can be passed to subsequent generations and by what mechanisms this may occur. Here we report the novel finding of a significant body length increase that persisted across at least two generations of offspring in response to maternal high-fat diet exposure. This phenotype is not attributable to altered intrauterine conditions or maternal feeding behavior because maternal and paternal lineages were able to transmit the effect, supporting a true epigenetic manner of inheritance. We also detected a heritable feature of reduced insulin sensitivity across two generations. Alterations in the GH secretagogue receptor (GHSR), the GHSR transcriptional repressor AF5q31, plasma IGF-I concentrations, and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) suggest a contribution of the GH axis. These studies provide evidence that the heritability of body length and glucose homeostasis are modulated by maternal diet across multiple generations, providing a mechanism where length can increase rapidly in concert with caloric availability.},

	abstract = {Natural selection favours phenotypes that match prevailing ecological conditions. A rapid process of adaptation is therefore required in changing environments. Maternal effects can facilitate such responses, but it is currently poorly understood under which circumstances maternal effects may accelerate or slow down the rate of phenotypic evolution. Here, we use a quantitative genetic model, including phenotypic plasticity and maternal effects, to suggest that the relationship between fitness and phenotypic variance plays an important role. Intuitive expectations that positive maternal effects are beneficial are supported following an extreme environmental shift, but, if too strong, that shift can also generate oscillatory dynamics that overshoot the optimal phenotype. In a stable environment, negative maternal effects that slow phenotypic evolution actually minimize variance around the optimum phenotype and thus maximize population mean fitness.},

@article{hsu_maternal_2016,
	abstract = {In oviparous species like birds, eggs provide the direct environment in which embryos are developing. Mothers may adjust different egg components in different ways in reaction to environmental cues either to adjust offspring development or because of constraints. In this study, we investigated the effects of food quality and quantity before and during egg laying on three different aspects of egg quality: macro-nutrients (egg and yolk mass), androgens (testosterone and androstenedione), and thyroid hormones (3,5,30-triiodothyronine, T3 and L-thyroxine, T4), using the rock pigeon (Columba livia). As expected, egg and yolk mass were significantly reduced for the eggs laid under the poorfood condition, indicating a maternal trade-off between offspring and self in allocating important resources. We did not find any significant change in yolk testosterone or their within-clutch pattern over the laying sequence. This is consistent with the fact that, in contrast with nutrients, these hormones are not costly to produce, but does not support the hypothesis that they play a role in adjusting brood size to food conditions. In contrast, we found that T3 levels were higher in the egg yolks under the poor-food condition whereas the total T4 content was lower. This change could be related to the fact that iodine, the critical constituent of thyroid hormones, might be a limiting factor in the production of this hormone. Given the knowledge that food restriction usually lead to reduction of circulating T3 levels, our results suggested that avian mothers can independently regulate its concentrations in their eggs from their own circulation. The study demonstrates that environmentally induced maternal effects via the egg can be a result of a combination of constrained resources and unconstrained signals and that thyroid hormones might be an interesting case of both. Therefore, this hormone and the interplay of different maternal effects on the offspring phenotype deserve much more attention.},

@article{kuijper_evolution_2014,
	abstract = {There is a growing interest in predicting the social and ecological contexts that favor the evolution of maternal effects. Most predictions focus, however, on maternal effects that affect only a single character, whereas the evolution of maternal effects is poorly understood in the presence of suites of interacting traits. To overcome this, we simulate the evolution of multivariate maternal effects (captured by the matrix M) in a fluctuating environment. We find that the rate of environmental fluctuations has a substantial effect on the properties of M: in slowly changing environments, offspring are selected to have a multivariate phenotype roughly similar to the maternal phenotype, so that M is characterized by positive dominant eigenvalues; by contrast, rapidly changing environments favor Ms with dominant eigenvalues that are negative, as offspring favor a phenotype which substantially differs from the maternal phenotype. Moreover, when fluctuating selection on one maternal character is temporally delayed relative to selection on other traits, we find a striking pattern of cross-trait maternal effects in which maternal characters influence not only the same character in offspring, but also other offspring characters. Additionally, when selection on one character contains more stochastic noise relative to selection on other traits, large cross-trait maternal effects evolve from those maternal traits that experience the smallest amounts of noise. The presence of these cross-trait maternal effects shows that individual maternal effects cannot be studied in isolation, and that their study in a multivariate context may provide important insights about the nature of past selection. Our results call for more studies that measure multivariate maternal effects in wild populations.},

	abstract = {An evaluation of the link between climate and population dynamics requires understanding of climate effects both within and across generations. In ectothermic vertebrates, demographic responses to climate changes should crucially depend on balancing needs for heat and water. Here, we studied how temperature and rainfall regimes experienced before and during adulthood influenced reproductive performances (litter size, offspring size, and survival) in a natural population of the live-bearing common lizard, Lacerta vivipara, monitored continuously from 1989 to 2004. Rainfall regime, but not temperature, had both immediate and delayed effects on these reproductive performances. Rainfall during the first month of life was positively correlated with juvenile survival. Females experiencing more rainfall during gestation produced smaller neonates that showed greater survival when controlling for the positive effect of body size on survival. Furthermore, females that experienced heavier rainfall when in utero produced fewer but longer neonates during adulthood. These demographic effects of rainfall on adult reproductive traits may come from maternal effects of climate conditions and/or from delayed effects of rainfall on the environment experienced early in life. Irrespective of the precise mechanism, however, this study provides evidence of intergenerational climate effects in natural populations of an ectothermic vertebrate.},

	abstract = {Maternal effects can have dramatic influences on the phenotype of offspring. Maternal effects can act as a conduit by which the maternal environment negatively affects offspring fitness, but they can also buffer offspring from environmental change by altering the phenotype of offspring according to local environmental conditions and as such, are a form of transgenerational plasticity. The benefits of maternal effects can be highly context dependent, increasing performance in one life-history stage but reducing it in another. While maternal effects are increasingly well understood in terrestrial systems, studies in the marine environment are typically restricted to a single, early life-history stage. Here, I examine the role of maternal effects across the life history of the bryozoan Bugula neritina. I exposed maternal colonies to a common pollution stress (copper) in the laboratory and then placed them in the field for one week to brood offspring. I then examined the resistance of offspring to copper from toxicant-exposed and toxicant-naı¨ ve mothers and found that offspring from toxicant-exposed mothers were larger, more dispersive, and more resistant to copper stress than offspring from naı¨ ve mothers. However, maternal exposure history had pervasive, negative effects on the post-metamorphic performance (particularly survival) of offspring: offspring from toxicant-exposed mothers had poorer performance after six weeks in the field, especially when facing high levels of intraspecific competition. Maternal experience can have complex effects on offspring phenotype, enhancing performance in one life-history stage while decreasing performance in another. The context-dependent costs and benefits associated with maternally derived pollution resistance may account for why such resistance is induced rather than continually expressed: mothers must balance the benefits of producing pollution-resistant larvae with the costs of producing poorer performing adults (in the absence of pollution).},

	abstract = {We employed a factorial laboratory experiment to determine the single and combined effect of maternal and larval exposure to contaminated sediment from Elizabeth River, Virginia, a site contaminated with high concentrations of multiple pollutants. Females were exposed to either reference or contaminated sediment and the larvae from both groups of mothers were in turn transferred to either reference or contaminated sediment. We found a strong maternal influence on yolk area, length and RNA:DNA ratio at hatch. Further, the maternal exposure significantly influenced growth rate and RNA:DNA ratios of larvae 14 days after hatch and was a more important factor in determining these endpoints than larval exposure. We found that after 14 days larvae were larger and had higher survivorship when the maternal and larval exposures were the same. There also was no statistical difference with respect to growth and condition between larvae that had hatched from exposed mothers and remained in contaminated water and larvae that had hatched from reference mothers and were placed in either reference or contaminated sediment. However, larvae that hatched from exposed mothers and then were switched to reference sediment had significantly lower growth, lower RNA:DNA ratios, and were smaller despite being large at hatch size, indicating that there are fitness trade-offs in exchange for apparent resistance to contaminants which are provided by the mother. Maternal effects add complexity to ecotoxicological research and should be incorporated into studies to predict population level responses more realistically.},

	abstract = {The timing of seasonal life-history events is assumed to evolve to synchronize life cycles with the availability of resources. Temporal variation in breeding time can have severe fitness consequences for the offspring, but the interplay between adult reproductive decisions and offspring phenotypes remains poorly understood. Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) is a potential mechanism allowing rapid responses to environmental change. Here, we investigated if experimentally delayed breeding induces TGP in larval life-history traits in the moor frog (Rana arvalis). We found clear evidence of TGP in response to changes in breeding phenology: delayed breeding increased offspring development and growth rates in the absence of external cues. This constitutes the first unequivocal evidence for TGP in response to changes in breeding phenology in vertebrates. TGP can play an important role in adjusting offspring life-history strategies to the environment they are most likely to encounter, and may constitute an important mechanism for coping with climate change.},

@article{shama_transgenerational_2016,
	abstract = {Transgenerational effects can buffer populations against environmental change, yet little is known about underlying mechanisms, their persistence or the influence of environmental cue timing. We investigated mitochondrial respiratory capacity (MRC) and gene expression of marine sticklebacks that experienced acute or developmental acclimation to simulated ocean warming (21$\,^{\circ}$C) across three generations. Previous work showed that acute acclimation of grandmothers to 21$\,^{\circ}$C led to lower (optimized) offspring MRCs. Here, developmental acclimation of mothers to 21$\,^{\circ}$C led to higher, but more efficient offspring MRCs. Offspring with a 21$\,^{\circ}$C 9 17$\,^{\circ}$C grandmother-mother environment mismatch showed metabolic compensation: their MRCs were as low as offspring with a 17$\,^{\circ}$C thermal history across generations. Transcriptional analyses showed primarily maternal but also grandmaternal environment effects: genes involved in metabolism and mitochondrial protein biosynthesis were differentially expressed when mothers developed at 21$\,^{\circ}$C, whereas 21$\,^{\circ}$C grandmothers influenced genes involved in hemostasis and apoptosis. Genes involved in mitochondrial respiration all showed higher expression when mothers developed at 21$\,^{\circ}$ and lower expression in the 21$\,^{\circ}$C 9 17$\,^{\circ}$C group, matching the phenotypic pattern for MRCs. Our study links transcriptomics to physiology under climate change, and demonstrates that mechanisms underlying transgenerational effects persist across multiple generations with specific outcomes depending on acclimation type and environmental mismatch between generations.},

	abstract = {The evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity relies on the presence of cues that enable organisms to adjust their phenotype to match local conditions. Although mostly studied with respect to nonsocial cues, it is also possible that parents transmit information about the environment to their offspring. Such `anticipatory parental effects' or `adaptive transgenerational plasticity' can have important consequences for the dynamics and adaptive potential of populations in heterogeneous environments. Yet, it remains unknown how widespread this form of plasticity is. Using a meta-analysis of experimental studies with a fully factorial design, we show that there is only weak evidence for higher offspring performance when parental and offspring environments are matched compared with when they are mismatched. Estimates of heterogeneity among studies suggest that effects, when they occur, are subtle. Study features, environmental context, life stage and trait categories all failed to explain significant amounts of variation in effect sizes. We discuss theoretical and methodological reasons for the limited evidence for anticipatory parental effects and suggest ways to improve our understanding of the prevalence of this form of plasticity in nature.},

However, few studies have examined how developmental stress influences an individual's cognitive phenotype. Using a viviparous lizard, we show that the availability of food resources to a mother during gestation influences a key component of her offspring's cognitive phenotype: their decision-making. Offspring from females who experienced low resource availability during gestation did better in an anti-predatory task that relied on spatial associations to guide their decisions, whereas offspring from females who experienced high resource availability during gestation did better in a foraging task that relied on colour associations to inform their decisions. This shows that the prenatal environment can influence decision-making in animals, a cognitive trait with functional implications later in life.},

@article{schluter_maternal_1993,
	abstract = {Maternal effects may strongly influence evolutionary response to natural selection but they have been little studied in the wild. We use a novel combination of experimental and statistical methods to estimate maternal effects on condition and clutch size in the collared flycatcher, where we define "condition" to be the nongenetic component of clutch size. We found evidence of two maternal effects.The first (m) was the negative effectofmother's clutch size on daughter's condition, when mother's condition was held constant. The second (M) was the positive effect of mother's condition on daughter's condition, when mother clutch size was held constant. These two effects oppose one another because mothers in good condition also lay many eggs. The maternal effects were large: Experimentally adding an egg to a mother's nest reduced clutch sizes of her daughters by V. egg (i.e., m = -0.25). Measured degree of resemblance between mother and daughter clutch sizes yielded M = 0.43. The results weakly support the presence of heritable genetic variation in clutch size: additive genetic variance/total phenotypic variance = 0.33. This estimate was highly variable probably because, as we show, mother-daughter resemblance may depend hardly at all on the amount of genetic variance when maternal effects are present. Daughter-mother regression (a standard method for estimating heritability) is consequently a poor guide to the amount of genetic variance in clutch size. Our results emphasize the value of combining field experiments with observations for studying inheritance.},

	abstract = {Environmental signals can induce phenotypic changes that span multiple generations. Along with phenotypic responses that occur during development (i.e. `within-generation' plasticity), such `transgenerational plasticity' (TGP) has been documented in a diverse array of taxa spanning many environmental perturbations. New theory predicts that temporal stability is a key driver of the evolution of TGP. We tested this prediction using natural populations of zooplankton from lakes in Connecticut that span a large gradient in the temporal dynamics of predator-induced mortality. We reared more than 120 clones of
              Daphnia ambigua
              from nine lakes for multiple generations in the presence/absence of predator cues. We found that temporal variation in mortality selects for within-generation plasticity while consistently strong (or weak) mortality selects for increased TGP. Such results provide us the first evidence for local adaptation in TGP and argue that divergent ecological conditions select for phenotypic responses within and across generations.},

Where mothers differ genetically or exhibit plastic variation in reproductive effort, there can be variation in per capita investment in offspring, and via this trade-off, variation in fecundity. Variation in per capita investment will affect juvenile performance directly---a classical maternal effect---while variation in fecundity will also affect offspring performance by altering the offsprings' competitive environment. The importance of this trade-off, while a focus of evolutionary research, is not often considered in discussions about population dynamics. Here, we use a factorial experiment to determine what proportion of variation in offspring performance can be ascribed to maternal effects and what proportion to the competitive environment linked to the size--number trade-off. Our results suggest that classical maternal effects are significant, but that in our system, the competitive environment, which is linked to maternal environments by fecundity, can be a far more substantial influence.},

Accumulating evidence indicates that nongenetic inheritance influences a diverse array of traits in all organisms and can allow for the transmission of environmentally induced phenotypic changes (`acquired traits'), as well as spontaneously arising and highly mutable variants. We review models of adaptation to changing environments under the assumption of a broadened model of inheritance that incorporates nongenetic mechanisms of transmission, and survey relevant empirical examples. Theory suggests that nongenetic inheritance can increase the rate of both phenotypic and genetic change and, in some cases, alter the direction of change. Empirical evidence shows that a diversity of phenotypes -- spanning a continuum from adaptive to pathological -- can be transmitted nongenetically. The presence of nongenetic inheritance therefore complicates our understanding of evolutionary responses to environmental change. We outline a research program encompassing experimental studies that test for transgenerational effects of a range of environmental factors, followed by theoretical and empirical studies on the population-level consequences of such effects.},

	abstract = {Changes in energy balance can lead to functional alterations at all levels of the hypothalamic--pituitary--adrenal (HPA) axis. However, relatively little is known about how energy balance affects functional properties of adrenocortical cells themselves. We investigated effects of restricted food intake on sensitivity to ACTH and rates of steroidogenesis in adrenocortical cells isolated from growing female and male Yarrow's Spiny Lizards (Sceloporus jarrovii). At the end of the feeding regimen, we assayed acute (3 h) progesterone (P4), corticosterone (B), and aldosterone (ALDO) production in response to ACTH in dispersed adrenocortical cells. Food restriction depressed growth rate by about 50\% in both males and females but did not alter baseline plasma B measured at 10 weeks in either sex. At the cellular level, food restriction had the following effects: (1) increased basal B production in both sexes and basal ALDO production in males, (2) increased net maximal rates of production of P4, B, and ALDO in response to ACTH, and (3) no overall effect on adrenocortical cellular sensitivity to ACTH. There were modest sex differences: overall rates of P4 production were 46\% greater in cells from females than from males, and in response to food restriction, the net maximal rate of ALDO production was 50\% greater in cells from males than from females. Our results demonstrate that food restriction in S. jarrovii increases adrenocortical cellular rates of steroid production without affecting overall cellular sensitivity to ACTH.},

@article{crino_under_2020,
	abstract = {Animals time reproductive events to overlap with periods of favorable environmental conditions. However, weather conditions can be unpredictable. Young animals may be particularly susceptible to extreme weather during sensitive developmental periods. Here, we investigated the effects of adverse weather conditions on corticosterone levels (a hormone linked to the avian stress response) and body condition of wild nestling zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). We sought to tease apart the direct versus indirect (i.e. parental) effects of weather on nestling physiology and condition by increasing parental work load with a clutch manipulation experiment. We found that high temperatures were associated with lower levels of restraint-induced corticosterone and high wind speeds were associated with higher levels of baseline corticosterone. We found no associations between weather and nestling body condition. However, clutch manipulation did affect body condition, with nestlings from experimentally enlarged clutches in worse condition compared to nestlings from experimentally reduced clutches. Our findings suggest that weather can directly affect wild nestlings via changes in corticosterone levels. Further research is needed to understand how changes in corticosterone levels affect phenotype and survival in wild nestlings. Understanding how developing animals respond to changes in environmental predictability and extreme weather is vital for understanding the potential for rapid adaptation in the face of changing climatic conditions.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity, both within and across generations, is an important mechanism that organisms use to cope with rapid climate change. While an increasing number of studies show that plasticity across generations (transgenerational plasticity or TGP) may occur, we have limited understanding of key aspects of TGP, such as the environmental conditions that may promote it, its relationship to withingeneration plasticity (WGP) and its role in evolutionary potential. In this review, we consider how the detection of TGP in climate change experiments is affected by the predictability of environmental variation, as well as the timing and magnitude of environmental change cues applied. We also discuss the need to design experiments that are able to distinguish TGP from selection and TGP from WGP in multigenerational experiments. We conclude by suggesting future research directions that build on the knowledge to date and admit the limitations that exist, which will depend on the way environmental change is simulated and the type of experimental design used. Such an approach will open up this burgeoning area of research to a wider variety of organisms and allow better predictive capacity of the role of TGP in the response of organisms to future climate change.},

@article{dowling_reactive_2009,
	abstract = {Evolutionary theory is firmly grounded on the existence of trade-offs between life-history traits, and recent interest has centred on the physiological mechanisms underlying such trade-offs. Several branches of evolutionary biology, particularly those focusing on ageing, immunological and sexual selection theory, have implicated reactive oxygen species (ROS) as profound evolutionary players. ROS are a highly reactive group of oxygen-containing molecules, generated as common by-products of vital oxidative enzyme complexes. Both animals and plants appear to intentionally harness ROS for use as molecular messengers to fulfil a wide range of essential biological processes. However, at high levels, ROS are known to exert very damaging effects through oxidative stress. For these reasons, ROS have been suggested to be important mediators of the cost of reproduction, and of trade-offs between metabolic rate and lifespan, and between immunity, sexual ornamentation and sperm quality. In this review, we integrate the above suggestions into one life-history framework, and review the evidence in support of the contention that ROS production will constitute a primary and universal constraint in life-history evolution.},

@article{eaton_mild_2015,
	abstract = {Maternal stress has been shown to affect behaviour of offspring in a wide range of animals, but this evidence has come from studies that exposed gestating mothers to acute or severe stressors, such as restraint or exposure to synthetic stress hormones. Here we show that exposure of mothers to even a mild stressor reduces associative learning and increases aggression in offspring. Female guppies were exposed to routine husbandry procedures that produced only a minimal, non-significant, elevation of the stress hormone cortisol. In contrast to controls, offspring from mothers that experienced this mild stress failed to learn to associate a colour cue and food reward, and showed a greater amount of inter-individual variation in behaviour compared with control offspring. This mild stress also resulted in offspring that were more aggressive towards their own mirror image than controls. While it is possible that these results could represent the transmission of beneficial maternal characteristics to offspring born into unpredictable environments, the potential for mild maternal stress to affect offspring performance also has important implications for research into the trans-generational effects of stress.},

@article{eyck_effects_2019,
	abstract = {Developmental stressors are increasingly recognised for their pervasive influence on the ecology and evolution of animals. In particular, many studies have focused on how developmental stress can give rise to variation in adult behaviour, physiology, and performance. However, there remains a poor understanding of whether general patterns exist in the effects and magnitude of phenotypic responses across taxonomic groups. Furthermore, given the extensive phenotypic variation that arises from developmental stressors, it remains important to ascertain how multiple processes may explain these responses. We compiled data from 111 studies to examine and quantify the effect of developmental stress on animal phenotype and performance from juveniles to adulthood, including studies from birds, reptiles, fish, mammals, insects, arachnids, and amphibians. Using meta-analytic approaches, we show that across all studies there is, on average, a moderate to large negative effect of developmental stress exposure (posterior mean effect: {\textbar}d{\textbar} = −0.51) on animal phenotype or performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that interactive effects of timing of stressor onset and the duration of exposure to stressors best explained variation in developmental stress responses. Animals exposed to stressors earlier in development had more-positive responses than those with later onset, whereas longer duration of exposure to a stressor caused responses to be stronger in magnitude. However, the high amount of heterogeneity in our results, and the low degree of variance explained by fixed effects in both the meta-analysis (R2 = 0.034) and top-ranked meta-regression model (R2 = 0.02), indicate that phenotypic responses to developmental stressors are likely highly idiosyncratic in nature and difficult to predict. Despite this, our analyses address a critical knowledge gap in understanding what effect developmental stress has on phenotypic variation in animals. Additionally, our results highlight important environmental and proximate factors that may influence phenotypic responses to developmental stressors.},

@article{friesen_morphspecific_2017,
	abstract = {Polymorphism has fascinated biologists for over a century because morphs persist within populations through evolutionary time in spite of showing disparate behavioral and physiological phenotypes; any one morph should go to fixation with the slightest fitness advantage over the others. Surely there must be trade-offs that balance selection on them. The polychromatic morphs of the Australian painted dragon lizard, Ctenophorus pictus, are one such system. The male color morphs of painted dragons have different physiological and behavioral traits including reproductive tactics, hormone levels, and the rate of body condition loss through the reproductive season. Due to their differences in physiology and reproductive tactics, we tested the hypotheses that male morphs would differ in resting metabolic rates (RMRs) and that the morphs' RMR would decline at different rates through the mating season. We found that bib-morphs (yellow gular patch) differ in RMR with bibbed (more aggressive) males having consistently higher RMR than non-bibbed males. Furthermore, we show that male dragons experience a decline in RMR as they age from reproductively active to inactive. We also found that the RMR of bibbed males has higher repeatability than non-bibbed males. Our results reinforce previous hypotheses about the morph-specific costs of bearing a gular patch in painted dragons.},

@article{friesen_telomeres_2022,
	abstract = {Ectotherms are classic models for understanding life-h-istory tradeoffs, including the reproduction---somatic maintenance tradeoffs that may be reflected in telomere length and their dynamics. Importantly, life--history traits of ectotherms are tightly linked to their thermal environment, with diverse or synergistic mechanistic explanations underpinning the variation. Telomere dynamics potentially provide a mechanistic link that can be used to monitor thermal effects on individuals in response to climatic perturbations. Growth rate, age and developmental stage are all affected by temperature, which interacts with telomere dynamics in complex and intriguing ways. The physiological processes underpinning telomere dynamics can be visualized and understood using thermal performance curves (TPCs). TPCs reflect the evolutionary history and the thermal environment during an individual's ontogeny. Telomere maintenance should be enhanced at or near the thermal performance optimum of a species, population and individual. The thermal sensitivity of telomere dynamics should reflect the interacting TPCs of the processes underlying them. The key processes directly underpinning telomere dynamics are mitochondrial function (reactive oxygen production), antioxidant activity, telomerase activity and telomere endcap protein status. We argue that identifying TPCs for these processes will significantly help design robust, repeatable experiments and field studies of telomere dynamics in ectotherms. Conceptually, TPCs are a valuable framework to predict and interpret taxon--and population--specific telomere dynamics across thermal regimes. The literature of thermal effects on telomeres in ectotherms is sparse and mostly limited to vertebrates, but our conclusions and recommendations are relevant across ectothermic animals.},

	abstract = {Avian eggs contain substantial amounts of maternal hormones and so provide an excellent model to study hormone-mediated maternal effects. We review this new and rapidly evolving field, taking an ecological and evolutionary approach and focusing on effects and function of maternal androgens in offspring development. Manipulation of yolk levels of androgens within the physiological range indicates that maternal androgens affect behaviour, growth, morphology, immune function and survival of the offspring, in some cases even long after fledging. Descriptive and experimental studies show systematic variation in maternal androgen deposition both within and among clutches, as well as in relation to the sex of the embryo. We discuss the potential adaptive value of maternal androgen transfer at all these three levels. We conclude that maternal androgen deposition in avian eggs provides a flexible mechanism of non-genetic inheritance, by which the mother can favour some offspring over others, and adjust their developmental trajectories to prevailing environmental conditions, producing different phenotypes. However, the literature is less consistent than often assumed and at all three levels, the functional explanations need further experimental testing. The field would greatly benefit from an analysis of the underlying physiological mechanisms.},

Evaluated together, such a collection of studies can offer insight into the importance and function of these factors in nature. Using a new factorial metaanalysis technique, we combined the results of 20 articles reporting on 39 published field experiments to ask whether the presence of predators affects the intensity of competitive effects and to compare the average effects of competition and predation. Across all studies, the effects of competition in the presence of predators were less than in the absence of predators, and the interaction between competition and predation for most response variables was statistically significant. Removal of competitors had much more positive effects on organisms' growth and mass than did exclusion of predators. Predator exclusion had much more beneficial effects on organisms' survival than did competition. The mean effects of competition and predation on density did not differ from one another. The results differed among trophic levels. Further understanding would benefit greatly from more field experiments that manipulate both competition and predation, that focus on a wider range of organisms and environments, that focus on population-level parameters such as density, and that report results more completely, including data such as sample sizes and variances.},

@article{hemmer-brepson_non-stressful_2013,
	abstract = {Temperature is well known to affect many biological and ecological traits, especially in ectotherms. From a physiological point of view, temperature is also positively correlated to metabolism and is often associated with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. It has recently been suggested that ROS play a role in lifespan and resource allocation. However, only a few authors have attempted to explore the relationships between temperature, resource allocation and oxidative balance in ectotherms. Here, we measured the effect of temperature on growth, reproductive effort, offspring quantity and quality, hatching and survival rates, and the associated proximal costs, which were evaluated through the quantification of oxidative balance elements. We reared adult fish (Oryzias latipes) at two non-stressful temperatures (20 and 30$\,^{\circ}$C) during a relatively long period (4 months, approximately the entire adult life). The results show a trade-off between reproduction and maintenance because investment toward growth could be neglected at the adult stage (confirmed by our results). Intriguingly, ROS-dependent damages did not differ between the two groups, probably because of the higher rate of activation of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase for warm-acclimated fish. The allocation toward antioxidant defences is associated with an earlier reproduction and a lower quality of offspring. These interesting results bring new perspectives in terms of the prediction of the impact of global warming on biota through the use of ecological theories based on oxidative balance and metabolism.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Animals display tremendous variation in their rates of growth, reproductive output, and longevity. While the physiological and molecular mechanisms that underlie this variation remain poorly understood, the performance of the mitochondrion has emerged as a key player. Mitochondria not only impact the performance of eukaryotes via their capacity to produce ATP, but they also play a role in producing heat and reactive oxygen species and function as a major signaling hub for the cell. The papers included in this special issue emerged from a symposium titled ``Inside the Black Box: The Mitochondrial Basis of Life-history Variation and Animal Performance.'' Based on studies of diverse animal taxa, three distinct themes emerged from these papers. (1) When linking mitochondrial function to components of fitness, it is crucial that mitochondrial assays are performed in conditions as close as the intracellular conditions experienced by the mitochondria in vivo. (2) Functional plasticity allows mitochondria to retain their performance, as well as that of their host, over a range of exogenous conditions, and selection on mitochondrial and nuclear-derived proteins can optimize the match between the environment and the bioenergetic capacity of the mitochondrion. Finally, (3) studies of wild and wild-derived animals suggest that mitochondria play a central role in animal performance and life history strategy. Taken as a whole, we hope that these papers will foster discussion and inspire new hypotheses and innovations that will further our understanding of the mitochondrial processes that underlie variation in life history traits and animal performance.},

@article{luquet_offspring_2016,
	abstract = {Background: Within-generational plasticity (WGP) and transgenerational plasticity (TGP) are mechanisms allowing rapid adaptive responses to fluctuating environments without genetic change. These forms of plasticity have often been viewed as independent processes. Recent evidence suggests that WGP is altered by the environmental conditions experienced by previous generations (i.e., TGP). In the context of inducible defenses, one of the most studied cases of plasticity, the WGP x TGP interaction has been poorly investigated.
Results: We provide evidence that TGP can alter the reaction norms of inducible defenses in a freshwater snail. The WGP x TGP interaction patterns are trait-specific and lead to decreased slope of reaction norms (behaviour and shell thickness). Offspring from induced parents showed a higher predator avoidance behaviour and a thicker shell than snails from non-induced parents in no predator-cue environment while they reached similar defenses in predator-cue environment. The WGP x TGP interaction further lead to a switch from a plastic towards a constitutive expression of defenses for shell dimensions (flat reaction norm).
Conclusions: WGP-alteration by TGP may shape the adaptive responses to environmental change and then has a substantial importance to understand the evolution of plasticity.},

@article{marasco_how_2022,
	abstract = {Although early-life adversity has been associated with negative consequences during adulthood, growing evidence shows that such adversity can also lead to subsequent stress resilience and positive fitness outcomes. Telomere dynamics are relevant in this context because of the link with developmental conditions and longevity. However, few studies have assessed whether the effects of early-life adversity on developmental telomere dynamics may relate to adult telomere dynamics. We propose that the potential links between early-life adversity and adult telomere dynamics could be driven by developmental constraints (the Constraint hypothesis), by the nature/severity of developmental adversity (the Resilience hypothesis), or by developmental-mediated changes in individual life-history strategies (the Pace of Life hypothesis). We discuss these non-mutually exclusive hypotheses, explore future research directions, and propose specific studies to test these hypotheses. Our article aims to expand our understanding of the evolutionary role of developmental conditions on adult telomere dynamics, stress resilience and ageing.},

@article{metcalfe_how_2022,
	abstract = {It is well known that oxidative stress is a major cause of DNA damage and telomere attrition. Most endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in the mitochondria, producing a link between mitochondrial function, DNA integrity and telomere dynamics. In this review we will describe how ROS production, rates of damage to telomeric DNA and DNA repair are dynamic processes. The rate of ROS production depends on mitochondrial features such as the level of inner membrane uncoupling and the proportion of time that ATP is actively being produced. However, the efficiency of ATP production (the ATP/O ratio) is positively related to the rate of ROS production, so leading to a trade--off between the body's energy requirements and its need to prevent oxidative stress. Telomeric DNA is especially vulnerable to oxidative damage due to features such as its high guanine content; while repair to damaged telomere regions is possible through a range of mechanisms, these can result in more rapid telomere shortening. There is increasing evidence that mitochondrial efficiency varies over time and with environmental context, as do rates of DNA repair. We argue that telomere dynamics can only be understood by appreciating that the optimal solution to the trade--off between energetic efficiency and telomere protection will differ between individuals and will change over time, depending on resource availability, energetic demands and life history strategy.},

@article{monaghan_somatic_2018,
	abstract = {Much telomere loss takes place during the period of most rapid growth when cell proliferation and potentially energy expenditure are high. Fast growth is linked to reduced longevity. Therefore, the effects of somatic cell proliferation on telomere loss and cell senescence might play a significant role in driving the growth-lifespan trade-off. While different species will have evolved a growth strategy that maximizes lifetime fitness, environmental conditions encountered during periods of growth will influence individual optima. In this review, we first discuss the routes by which altered cellular conditions could influence telomere loss in vertebrates, with a focus on oxidative stress in both
              in vitro
              and
              in vivo
              studies. We discuss the relationship between body growth and telomere length, and evaluate the empirical evidence that this relationship is generally negative. We further discuss the potentially conflicting hypotheses that arise when other factors are taken into account, and the further work that needs to be undertaken to disentangle confounding variables.

	abstract = {Phenotypic development is the result of a complex interplay involving the organism's own genetic make-up and the environment it experiences during development. The latter encompasses not just the current environment, but also indirect, and sometimes lagged, components that result from environmental effects on its parents that are transmitted to their developing offspring in various ways and at various stages. These environmental effects can simply constrain development, for example, where poor maternal condition gives rise to poorly provisioned, low-quality offspring. However, it is also possible that environmental circumstances during development shape the offspring phenotype in such a way as to better prepare it for the environmental conditions it is most likely to encounter during its life. Studying the extent to which direct and indirect developmental responses to environmental effects are adaptive requires clear elucidation of hypotheses and careful experimental manipulations. In this paper, I outline how the different paradigms applied in this field relate to each other, the main predictions that they produce and the kinds of experimental data needed to distinguish among competing hypotheses. I focus on birds in particular, but the theories discussed are not taxon specific. Environmental influences on phenotypic development are likely to be mediated, in part at least, by endocrine systems. I examine evidence from mechanistic and functional avian studies and highlight the general areas where we lack key information.},

Synthesizing estimates derived from detailed pedigrees, we evaluated the amount of phenotypic variation determined by maternal effects in animal populations. Maternal effects account for half as much phenotypic variation within populations as do additive genetic effects. Maternal effects most greatly affect morphology and phenology but, surprisingly, are not stronger in species with prolonged maternal care than in species without. While maternal effects influence juvenile traits more than adult traits on average, they do not decline across ontogeny for behaviour or physiology, and they do not weaken across the life cycle in species without maternal care. These findings underscore maternal effects as an important source of phenotypic variation and emphasise their potential to affect many ecological and evolutionary processes.},

	abstract = {Alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) are predicted to be the result of disruptive correlational selection on suites of morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits. ARTs are most obvious when they occur in discrete morphs with concomitant behavioral tactics. However, ARTs driven by behavior in species lacking obvious phenotypic differences are rarely documented and poorly understood. We quantified selection acting on phenotypic traits predicted to characterize ARTs by observing marked lizards in six seminatural populations. We quantified reproductive fitness for each male using six microsatellite DNA loci from 226 offspring born to 56 females. Candidate models containing directional and correlational selection gradients were equally supported. As predicted, large males with large home ranges and large males that were observed frequently had the highest reproductive success. We also found evidence that large males that moved little but that were observed frequently and large males that moved frequently but that were observed little were predicted to have high fitness. Model predictions support our verbal hypothesis regarding the phenotypes characterizing ARTs and suggest that large males may be adopting subtly different tactics to acquire paternity. Our results suggest that disruptive correlational selection between behavioral traits may drive the evolution of ARTs in ``cryptic'' systems that lack overt polymorphisms.},

	abstract = {Evidence of social learning, whereby the actions of an animal facilitate the acquisition of new information by another, is taxonomically biased towards mammals, especially primates, and birds. However, social learning need not be limited to group-living animals because species with less interaction can still benefit from learning about potential predators, food sources, rivals and mates. We trained male skinks (
              Eulamprus quoyii
              ), a mostly solitary lizard from eastern Australia, in a two-step foraging task. Lizards belonging to `young' and `old' age classes were presented with a novel instrumental task (displacing a lid) and an association task (reward under blue lid). We did not find evidence for age-dependent learning of the instrumental task; however, young males in the presence of a demonstrator learnt the association task faster than young males without a demonstrator, whereas old males in both treatments had similar success rates. We present the first evidence of age-dependent social learning in a lizard and suggest that the use of social information for learning may be more widespread than previously believed.},

@article{noble_developmental_2018,
	abstract = {Early environments can profoundly influence an organism in ways that persist over its life. In reptiles, early thermal environments (nest temperatures) can impact offspring phenotype and survival in important ways, yet we still lack an understanding of whether general trends exist and the magnitude of impact. Understanding these patterns is important in predicting how climate change will affect reptile populations and the role of phenotypic plasticity in buffering populations. We compiled data from 175 reptile studies to examine, and quantify, the effect of incubation temperature on phenotype and survival. Using meta-analytic approaches (standardized mean difference between incubation treatments, Hedges' g), we show that across all trait types examined there is, on average, a moderate to large magnitude of effect of incubation temperatures (absolute effect: {\textbar}g{\textbar} = 0.75). Unsurprisingly, this influence was extremely large for incubation duration, as predicted, with warmer temperatures decreasing incubation time overall (g = −8.42). Other trait types, including behaviour, physiology, morphology, performance, and survival experienced reduced, but still mostly moderate to large effects, with particularly strong effects on survival. Moreover, the impact of incubation temperature persisted at least one-year post-hatching, suggesting that these effects have the potential to impact fitness in the long term. The magnitude of effect increased as the change in temperature increased (e.g. 6◦C versus 2◦C) in almost all cases, and tended to decrease when temperatures of the treatments fluctuated around a mean temperature compared to when they were constant. The effect also depended on the mid-temperature of the comparison, but not in consistent ways, with some traits experiencing the greatest effects at extreme temperatures, while others did not. The highly heterogeneous nature of the effects we observe, along with a large amount of unexplained variability, indicates that the shape of reaction norms between phenotype and temperature, along with ecological and/or experimental factors, are important when considering general patterns. Our analyses provide new insights into the effects of incubation environments on reptile phenotype and survival and allow general, albeit coarse, predictions for taxa experiencing warming nest temperatures under climatic change.},

@article{noble_plastic_2019,
	abstract = {Environmentally induced phenotypes have been proposed to initiate and bias adaptive evolutionary change toward particular directions. The potential for this to happen depends in part on how well plastic responses are aligned with the additive genetic variance and covariance in traits. Using meta-analysis, we demonstrate that plastic responses to novel environments tend to occur along phenotype dimensions that harbor substantial amounts of additive genetic variation. This suggests that selection for or against environmentally induced phenotypes typically will be effective. One interpretation of the alignment between the direction of plasticity and the main axis of additive genetic variation is that developmental systems tend to respond to environmental novelty as they do to genetic mutation. This makes it challenging to distinguish if the direction of evolution is biased by plasticity or genetic ``constraint.'' Our results therefore highlight a need for new theoretical and empirical approaches to address the role of plasticity in evolution.},

@article{olsson_ectothermic_2018,
	abstract = {We review the evolutionary ecology and genetics of telomeres in taxa that cannot elevate their body temperature to a preferred level through metabolism but do so by basking or seeking out a warm environment. This group of organisms contains all living things on earth, apart from birds and mammals. One reason for our interest in this synthetic group is the argument that high, stable body temperature increases the risk of malignant tumours if long, telomerase-restored telomeres make cells `live forever'. If this holds true, ectotherms should have significantly lower cancer frequencies. We discuss to what degree there is support for this `anti-cancer' hypothesis in the current literature. Importantly, we suggest that ectothermic taxa, with variation in somatic telomerase expression across tissue and taxa, may hold the key to understanding ongoing selection and evolution of telomerase dynamics in the wild. We further review endotherm-specific effects of growth on telomeres, effects of autotomy (`tail dropping') on telomere attrition, and costs of maintaining sexual displays measured in telomere attrition. Finally, we cover plant ectotherm telomeres and life histories in a separate `mini review'.

@article{olsson_longterm_2018,
	abstract = {Telomeres are the non--coding protein--nucleotide ``caps'' at chromosome ends that contribute to chromosomal stability by protecting the coding parts of the linear DNA from shortening at cell division, and from erosion by reactive molecules. Recently, there has been some controversy between molecular and cell biologists, on the one hand, and evolutionary ecologists on the other, regarding whether reactive molecules erode telomeres during oxidative stress. Many studies of biochemistry and medicine have verified these relationships in cell culture, but other researchers have failed to find such effects in free-l-iving vertebrates. Here, we use a novel approach to measure free radicals (superoxide), mitochondrial ``content'' (a combined measure of mitochondrial number and size in cells), telomere length and DNA damage at two primary time points during the mating season of an annual lizard species (Ctenophorus pictus). Superoxide levels early in the mating season vary widely and elevated levels predict shorter telomeres both at that time as well as several months later. These effects are likely driven by mitochondrial content, which significantly impacts late season superoxide (cells with more mitochondria have more superoxide), but superoxide effects on telomeres are counteracted by DNA repair as revealed by 8--hydroxy--2′--deoxyguanosine assays. We conclude that reactive oxygen species and DNA repair are fundamental for both short--and long--term regulation of lizard telomere length with pronounced effects of early season cellular stress detectable on telomere length near lizard death.},

@article{pettersen_understanding_2018,
	abstract = {Metabolic rate reflects an organism's capacity for growth, maintenance and reproduction, and is likely to be a target of selection. Physiologists have long sought to understand the causes and consequences of within-individual to among-species variation in metabolic rates -- how metabolic rates relate to performance and how they should evolve. Traditionally, this has been viewed from a mechanistic perspective, relying primarily on hypothesis-driven approaches. A more agnostic, but ultimately more powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of phenotypic variation is through use of the breeder's equation, because variation in metabolic rate is likely to be a consequence of underlying microevolutionary processes. Here we show that metabolic rates are often significantly heritable, and are therefore free to evolve under selection. We note, however, that `metabolic rate' is not a single trait: in addition to the obvious differences between metabolic levels (e.g. basal, resting, free-living, maximal), metabolic rate changes through ontogeny and in response to a range of extrinsic factors, and is therefore subject to multivariate constraint and selection. We emphasize three key advantages of studying metabolic rate within a quantitative genetics framework: its formalism, and its predictive and comparative power. We make several recommendations when applying a quantitative genetics framework: (i) measuring selection based on actual fitness, rather than proxies for fitness; (ii) considering the genetic covariances between metabolic rates throughout ontogeny; and (iii) estimating genetic covariances between metabolic rates and other traits. A quantitative genetics framework provides the means for quantifying the evolutionary potential of metabolic rate and why variance in metabolic rates within populations might be maintained.},

@article{rohr_climate_2013,
	abstract = {Climate change is believed to be causing declines of ectothermic vertebrates, but there is little evidence that climatic conditions associated with declines have exceeded critical (i.e., acutely lethal) maxima or minima, and most relevant studies are correlative, anecdotal, or short-term (hours). We conducted an 11-week factorial experiment to examine the effects of temperature (22 ◦C or 27 ◦C), moisture (wet or dry), and atrazine (an herbicide; 0, 4, 40, 400 μg/L exposure as embryos and larvae) on the survival, growth, behavior, and foraging rates of postmetamorphic streamside salamanders (Ambystoma barbouri), a species of conservation concern. The tested climatic conditions were between the critical maxima and minima of streamside salamanders; thus, this experiment quantified the long-term effects of climate change within the noncritical range of this species. Despite a suite of behavioral adaptations to warm and dry conditions (e.g., burrowing, refuge use, huddling with conspecifics, and a reduction in activity), streamside salamanders exhibited significant loss of mass and significant mortality in all but the cool and moist conditions, which were closest to the climatic conditions in which they are most active in nature. A temperature of 27 ◦C represented a greater mortality risk than dry conditions; death occurred rapidly at this temperature and more gradually under cool and dry conditions. Foraging decreased under dry conditions, which suggests there were opportunity costs to water conservation. Exposure to the herbicide atrazine additively decreased water-conserving behaviors, foraging efficiency, mass, and time to death. Hence, the hypothesis that moderate climate change can cause population declines is even more plausible under scenarios with multiple stressors. These results suggest that climate change within the noncritical range of species and pollution may reduce individual performance by altering metabolic demands, hydration, and foraging effort and may facilitate population declines of amphibians and perhaps other ectothermic vertebrates.},

@article{ruuskanen_effects_2016,
	abstract = {Maternal effects are a crucial mechanism in a wide array of taxa to generate phenotypic variation, thereby affecting offspring development and fitness. Maternally derived thyroid hormones (THs) are known to be essential for offspring development in mammalian and fish models, but have been largely neglected in avian studies, especially in respect to natural variation and an ecological context. We studied, for the first time in a wild species and population, the effects of maternally derived THs on offspring development, behavior, physiology and fitness-related traits by experimental elevation of thyroxine and triiodothyronine in ovo within the physiological range in great tits (Parus major). We found that elevated yolk TH levels had a sex-specific effect on growth, increasing male and decreasing female growth, relative to controls, and this effect was similar throughout the nestling period. Hatching or fledging success, motor coordination behavior, stress reactivity and resting metabolic rate were not affected by the TH treatment. We conclude that natural variation in maternally derived THs may affect some offspring traits in a wild species. As this is the first study on yolk thyroid hormones in a wild species and population, more such studies are needed to investigate its effects on pre-hatching development, and juvenile and adult fitness before generalizations on the importance of maternally derived yolk thyroid hormones can be made. However, this opens a new, interesting avenue for further research in the field of hormone mediated maternal effects.},

@article{salin_variation_2015,
	abstract = {It is often assumed that an animal's metabolic rate can be estimated through measuring the whole-organism oxygen consumption rate. However, oxygen consumption alone is unlikely to be a sufficient marker of energy metabolism in many situations. This is due to the inherent variability in the link between oxidation and phosphorylation; that is, the amount of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generated per molecule of oxygen consumed by mitochondria (P/O ratio). In this article, we describe how the P/O ratio can vary within and among individuals, and in response to a number of environmental parameters, including diet and temperature. As the P/O ratio affects the efficiency of cellular energy production, its variability may have significant consequences for animal performance, such as growth rate and reproductive output. We explore the adaptive significance of such variability and hypothesize that while a reduction in the P/O ratio is energetically costly, it may be associated with advantages in terms of somatic maintenance through reduced production of reactive oxygen species. Finally, we discuss how considering variation in mitochondrial efficiency, together with whole-organism oxygen consumption, can permit a better understanding of the relationship between energy metabolism and life history for studies in evolutionary ecology.},

	abstract = {Transgenerational plasticity (TGP), a generalisation of more widely studied maternal effects, occurs whenever environmental cues experienced by either parent prior to fertilisation results in a modification of offspring reaction norms. Such effects have been observed in many traits across many species. Despite enormous potential importance---particularly in an era of rapid climate change---TGP in thermal growth physiology has never been demonstrated for vertebrates. We provide the first evidence for thermal TGP in a vertebrate: given sufficient time, sheepshead minnows adaptively program their offspring for maximal growth at the present temperature. The change in growth over a single generation (c. 30\%) exceeds the single-generation rate of adaptive evolution by an order of magnitude. If widespread, transgenerational effects on thermal performance may have important implications on physiology, ecology and contemporary evolution, and may significantly alter the extinction risk posed by changing climate.},

	abstract = {Climate change continues to impact species worldwide. Understanding and predicting how populations will respond is of clear importance. Here, we review a mechanism by which populations may respond rapidly to these changes: Trans-Generational Plasticity (TGP). TGP exists when the environment experienced by the parents affects the shape of the reaction norm in their offspring; that is, the parental and offspring environments interact to determine the offspring phenotype. We survey 80 empirical studies from 63 species (32 orders, 9 phyla) that demonstrate TGP. Overall, TGP is taxonomically widespread and present in response to environmental drivers likely to be impacted by climate change. Although many examples now exist, we also identify areas of research that could greatly improve our understanding of TGP. We conclude that TGP is sufficiently established both theoretically and empirically to merit study as a potential coping tactic against rapid environmental changes.},

@article{smith_meta-analysis_2016,
	abstract = {Oxidative stress (OS) as a proximate mechanism for life-history trade-offs is widespread in the literature. One such resource allocation trade-off involves growth rate, and theory suggests that OS might act as both a constraint on and a cost of growth, yet studies investigating this have produced conflicting results. Here, we use meta-analysis to investigate whether increased OS levels impact on growth (OS as a constraint on growth) and whether greater growth rates can increase OS (OS as a cost of growth). The role of OS as a constraint on growth was supported by the meta-analysis. Greater OS, in terms of either increased damage or reduced levels of antioxidants, was associated with reduced growth although the effect depended on the experimental manipulation used. Our results also support an oxidative cost of growth, at least in terms of increased oxidative damage, although faster growth was not associated with a change in antioxidant levels. These findings that OS can act as a constraint on growth support theoretical links between OS and animal life histories and provide evidence for a growth--self-maintenance trade-off. Furthermore, the apparent oxidative costs of growth imply individuals cannot alter this trade-off when faced with enhanced growth. We offer a starting platform for future research and recommend the use of oxidative damage biomarkers in nonlethal tissue to investigate the growth--OS relationship further.},

@article{sun_thyroid_2016,
	abstract = {The adaptive significance of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) has attracted a great deal of research, but the underlying mechanisms by which temperature determines the sex of a developing embryo remain poorly understood. Here, we manipulated the level of a thyroid hormone (TH), triiodothyronine (T
              3
              ), during embryonic development (by adding excess T
              3
              to the eggs of the red-eared slider turtle
              Trachemys scripta
              , a reptile with TSD), to test two competing hypotheses on the proximate basis for TSD: the
              developmental rate hypothesis
              versus the
              hormone hypothesis
              . Exogenous TH accelerated embryonic heart rate (and hence metabolic rate), developmental rate, and rates of early post-hatching growth. More importantly, hyperthyroid conditions depressed expression of
              Cyp19a1
              (the gene encoding for aromatase) and levels of oestradiol, and induced more male offspring. This result is contrary to the direction of sex-ratio shift predicted by the
              developmental rate hypothesis
              , but consistent with that predicted by the
              hormone hypothesis
              . Our results suggest an important role for THs in regulating sex steroid hormones, and therefore, in affecting gonadal sex differentiation in TSD reptiles. Our study has implications for the conservation of TSD reptiles in the context of global change because environmental contaminants may disrupt the activity of THs, and thereby affect offspring sex in TSD reptiles.},

	abstract = {Corticosterone exposure during prenatal development as a result of maternal upregulation of circulating hormone levels has been shown to have effects on offspring development in mammals. Corticosterone has also been documented in egg yolk in oviparous vertebrates, but the extent to which this influences phenotypic development is less studied. We show that maternal corticosterone is transferred to egg yolk in an oviparous lizard (the mallee dragon, Ctenophorus fordi Storr), with significant variation among clutches in hormone levels. Experimental elevation of yolk corticosterone did not affect hatching success, incubation period or offspring sex ratio. However, corticosterone did have a sex-specific effect on skeletal growth during embryonic development. Male embryos exposed to relatively high levels of corticosterone were smaller on average than control males at hatching whereas females from hormone-treated eggs were larger on average than control females. The data thus suggest that males are not just more sensitive to the detrimental effects of corticosterone but rather that the sexes may have opposite responses to corticosterone during development. Positive selection on body size at hatching for both sexes in this species further suggests that increased corticosterone in egg yolk may have sex-specific fitness consequences, with potential implications for sex allocation and the evolution of hormone-mediated maternal effects.},

@article{__2017,
	abstract = {Food availability significantly affects an animal's energy metabolism, and thus its phenotype, survival, and reproduction. Maternal and offspring responses to food conditions are critical for understanding population dynamics and life-history evolution of a species. In this study, we conducted food manipulation experiments in field enclosures to identify the effect of food restriction on female reproductive traits and postpartum body condition, as well as on hatchling phenotypes, in a lacertid viviparous lizard from the Inner Mongolian desert steppe of China. Females under low-food availability treatment (LFT) had poorer immune function and body condition compared with those under high-food availability treatment (HFT). The food availability treatments significantly affected the litter size and litter mass of the females, but not their gestation period in captivity or brood success, or the body size, sprint speed, and sex ratio of the neonates. Females from the LFT group had smaller litter sizes and, therefore, lower litter mass than those from the HFT group. These results suggest that female racerunners facing food restriction lay fewer offspring with unchanged body size and locomotor performance, and incur a cost in the form of poor postpartum body condition and immune function. The flexibility of maternal responses to variable food availability represents an important life strategy that could enhance the resistance of lizards to unpredictable environmental change.},

In particular, prey availability can influence maternal reproduction and, in turn, affect the viability of their offspring. Although such maternal effects are widespread, the mechanisms by which these effects operate are poorly understood. We manipulated the amount of prey available to female brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) to evaluate how this factor affects patterns of reproductive investment (total egg output, egg size, yolk steroids) and offspring viability (morphology, growth, survival). Experimental reduction of yolk in a subset of eggs enabled us to evaluate a potential causal mechanism (yolk investment) that mediates the effect of maternal prey availability on offspring viability. We show that limited prey availability significantly reduced egg size, which negatively influenced offspring size, growth, and survival. Experimental yolk removal from eggs directly reduced offspring size, which, in turn, negatively affected offspring growth and survival. These findings show that maternal environments (i.e., low prey) can affect offspring fitness via an indirect effect of yolk investment on offspring size and highlight the complex set of indirect effects by which maternal effects can operate.},

Although all eggs were incubated at the same temperature, and yolk steroid hormone levels were not correlated with offspring sex, the nutrient-deprived females produced highly male-biased sex ratios among their offspring. These responses to maternal nutrition generate a link between sex and offspring size, in a direction likely to enhance maternal fitness if large body size enhances reproductive success more in sons than in daughters (as seems plausible, given the mating system of this species). Overall, our results show that sex determination in these animals is more complex, and responsive to a wider range of environmental cues, than that suggested by the classification of `environmental sex determination'.},

@article{yin_transgenerational_2019,
	abstract = {The adaptive value of transgenerational effects (the ancestor environmental effects on offspring) in changing environments has received much attention in recent years, but the related empirical evidence remains equivocal. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis summarising 139 experimental studies in plants and animals with 1170 effect sizes to investigate the generality of transgenerational effects across taxa, traits, and environmental contexts. It was found that transgenerational effects generally enhanced offspring performance in response to both stressful and benign conditions. The strongest effects are in annual plants and invertebrates, whereas vertebrates appear to benefit mostly under benign conditions, and perennial plants show hardly any transgenerational responses at all. These differences among taxonomic/life-history groups possibly reflect that vertebrates can avoid stressful conditions through their mobility, and longer-lived plants have alternative strategies. In addition to environmental contexts and taxonomic/life-history groups, transgenerational effects also varied among traits and developmental stages of ancestors and offspring, but the effects were similarly strong across three generations of offspring. By way of a more comprehensive data set and a different effect size, our results differ from those of a recent meta-analysis, suggesting that transgenerational effects are widespread, strong and persistent and can substantially impact the responses of plants and animals to changing environments.},

Metabolic rates are sensitive to changes in temperature and oxygen availability, but effects of food availability, particularly on maximum metabolic rates, are not well understood. Here, we show in brown trout (

As a result, aerobic scope (i.e. the capacity to elevate metabolism above baseline requirements) declines as food availability increases. These differential changes in metabolic rates likely have important consequences for how organisms partition available metabolic power to different functions under the constraints imposed by food availability.},

We currently have a poor understanding of the learning ability of young animals within the first few months of their life, the types of learning they use and the extent of their learning ability. Furthermore, an animal's developmental environment, such as nest incubation temperature, may profoundly influence motor and cognitive skills. We first tested the ability of hatchling three-lined skinks (Bassiana duperreyi) incubated at `hot' and `cold' temperatures to solve an instrumental (motor) task before assessing their ability to learn colour associations in a multi-stage instrumental task, with a choice reversal. While 53 (88.3 \%) lizards successfully completed the training phase, 14 (46.7 \%) of the `hot' incubated and none of the `cold' incubated lizards successfully completed the instrumental task. Thirteen of these lizards rapidly learnt to discriminate colours, and this culminated in eight individuals successfully completing a choice reversal. Hatchling B . duperreyi demonstrated surprisingly rapid learning, and these results highlight the potentially important role of cognition during development and ultimately, in fitness.},

Although thoroughly documented in vertebrate clades such as mammals and birds, studies of procedural memory in squamate reptiles are lacking. Filling the gap in knowledge regarding procedural memory in squamates is important to understanding the degree to which procedural memory is unique to birds and mammals, as it is related to their unique cognitive abilities. We tested for memory of a problem-solving task in two species of monitor lizard (Varanus spp.) and a beaded lizard (Heloderma sp.) after a 20-mo hiatus in exposure, representing approximately 25\% of their ages at the time of testing. All the monitor lizards had lower initial latencies to solve the task upon re-exposure posthiatus than they had as naı¨ ve individuals during the prehiatus trials and reached minimum latencies in fewer trials than when previously tested. Our results indicate procedural memory of puzzle-solving behaviors on the time scales of years. Our results add to an emerging literature suggesting that squamate and other nonavian reptiles share a number of cognitive traits with birds and mammals, suggesting that such traits are far more widespread across taxa than previously recognized. We also discuss a framework for studying cognition in squamates that would allow tests of cognition across a great diversity of body forms and ecologies.},

@article{soldati_long-term_2017,
	abstract = {Long-term memory can be adaptive as it allows animals to retain information that is crucial for survival, such as the appearance and location of key resources. This is generally examined by comparing choices of stimuli that have value to the animal with those that do not; however, in nature choices are rarely so clear cut. Animals are able to assess the relative value of a resource via direct comparison, but it remains unclear whether they are able to retain this information for a biologically meaningful amount of time. To test this, captive red-footed tortoises (
              Chelonoidis carbonaria
              ) were first trained to associate visual cues with specific qualities and quantities of food, and their preferences for the different reward values determined. They were then retested after an interval of 18 months. We found that the tortoises were able to retain the information they had learned about the cues as indicators of relative reward values over this interval, demonstrating a memory for the relative quantity and quality of food over an extended period of time. This is likely to impact directly on an animal's foraging decisions, such as the exploitation of seasonally varying resources, with obvious fitness implications for the individual; however, the implications may also extend to the ecological interactions in which the animal is involved, affecting processes such as herbivory and seed dispersal.},

@article{ahmad_dysfunction_2018,
	abstract = {Background: Lead (Pb) is a widespread environmental neurotoxin and its exposure even in minute quantities can lead to compromised neuronal functions. A developing brain is particularly vulnerable to Pb mediated toxicity and early-life exposure leads to permanent alterations in brain development and neuronal signaling and plasticity, culminating into cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions and elevated risk of neuropsychiatric disorders later in life. Nevertheless, the underlying biochemical mechanisms have not been completely discerned.
Methods: Because of their ability to fulfill high energy needs and to act as calcium buffers in events of high intensity neuronal activity as well as their adaptive regulatory capability to match the requirements of the dynamicity of synaptic signaling, synapse-specific or synaptic mitochondria (SM) are critical for synaptic development, function and plasticity. Our aim for the present study hence was to characterize the effects of early-life Pb exposure on the functions of SM of prepubertal rats. For this purpose, employing a chronic model of Pb neurotoxicity, we exposed rat pups perinatally and postnatally to Pb and used a plethora of colorimetric and fluorometric assays for assessing redox and bioenergetic properties of SM. In addition, taking advantage of its ability as an antioxidant and as a metal chelator, we employed ascorbic acid (vitamin C) supplementation as an ameliorative therapeutic strategy against Pb-induced neurotoxicity and dysfunction of SM.
Results: Our results suggest that early-life exposure to Pb leads to elevated oxidative stress in cortical SM with consequent compromises in its energy metabolism activity. Ascorbate supplementation resulted in significant recovery of Pb-induced oxidative stress and functional compromise of SM.
Conclusion: Alterations in redox status and bioenergetic properties of SM could potentially contribute to the synaptic dysfunction observed in events of Pb neurotoxicity. Additionally, our study provides evidence for suitability of ascorbate as a significant ameliorative agent in tacking Pb neurotoxicity.},

	abstract = {Developmental stressors often have long-term fitness consequences, but linking offspring traits to fitness prospects has remained a challenge. Telomere length predicts mortality in adult birds, and may provide a link between developmental conditions and fitness prospects. Here, we examine the effects of manipulated brood size on growth, telomere dynamics and post-fledging survival in free-living jackdaws. Nestlings in enlarged broods achieved lower mass and lost 21\% more telomere repeats relative to nestlings in reduced broods, showing that developmental stress accelerates telomere shortening. Adult telomere length was positively correlated with their telomere length as nestling (
              r
              = 0.83). Thus, an advantage of long telomeres in nestlings is carried through to adulthood. Nestling telomere shortening predicted post-fledging survival and recruitment independent of manipulation and fledgling mass. This effect was strong, with a threefold difference in recruitment probability over the telomere shortening range. By contrast, absolute telomere length was neither affected by brood size manipulation nor related to survival. We conclude that telomere loss, but not absolute telomere length, links developmental conditions to subsequent survival and suggest that telomere shortening may provide a key to unravelling the physiological causes of developmental effects on fitness.},

@article{boutilier_plasticity_nodate,
	abstract = {Summary The common frog (Rana temporaria) spends the coldest months of each year overwintering in ice-covered ponds where temperatures can vary from 0.5 to 4.0 $\,^{\circ}$C. Over the course of a winter season, the animals enter progressively into a state of metabolic depression that relies almost exclusively on aerobic production of ATP. However, if aerobic metabolism is threatened, for example by increasingly hypoxic conditions, decreases in the animal's metabolic rate can reach upwards of 75 \% compared with the 50 \% decrease seen during normoxia. Under these conditions, the major proportion of the overall reduction in whole-animal metabolic rate can be accounted for by metabolic suppression of the skeletal muscle (which makes up approximately 40 \% of body mass). Little is known about the properties of mitochondria during prolonged periods of metabolic depression, so we have examined several aspects of mitochondrial metabolism in the skeletal muscle of frogs over periods of hibernation of up to 4 months. Mitochondria isolated from the skeletal muscle of frogs hibernating in hypoxic water show a considerable reorganisation of function compared with those isolated from normoxic submerged animals at the same temperature (3 $\,^{\circ}$C). Both the active (state 3) and resting (state 4) respiration rates of mitochondria decrease during hypoxic, but not normoxic, hibernation. In addition, the affinity of mitochondria for oxygen increases during periods of acute hypoxic stress during normoxic hibernation as well as during long-term hibernation in hypoxic water. The decrease in mitochondrial state 4 respiration rates during hypoxic hibernation evidently occurs through a reduction in electron-transport chain activity, not through a lowered proton conductance of the mitochondrial inner membrane. The reduced aerobic capacity of frog skeletal muscle during hypoxic hibernation is accompanied by lowered activities of key enzymes of mitochondrial metabolism caused by changes in the intrinsic properties of the mitochondria. In the absence of oxygen, the mitochondrial F1Fo-ATPase (the ATP synthase) begins to run backwards as it actively pumps protons from the matrix in an attempt to maintain the mitochondrial membrane potential. At this time, the ATP synthase functions as an ATPase to preserve a certain proton-motive force. Frogs limit ATP wastage during anoxia by a profound inhibition of the ATP synthase. Taken together, our studies show that protonmotive force is lowered aerobically by restricting electron supply and during anoxia by restricting mitochondrial ATPase activity.},

@article{brand_assessing_2011,
	abstract = {Assessing mitochondrial dysfunction requires definition of the dysfunction to be investigated. Usually, it is the ability of the mitochondria to make ATP appropriately in response to energy demands. Where other functions are of interest, tailored solutions are required. Dysfunction can be assessed in isolated mitochondria, in cells or in vivo, with different balances between precise experimental control and physiological relevance. There are many methods to measure mitochondrial function and dysfunction in these systems. Generally, measurements of fluxes give more information about the ability to make ATP than do measurements of intermediates and potentials. For isolated mitochondria, the best assay is mitochondrial respiratory control: the increase in respiration rate in response to ADP. For intact cells, the best assay is the equivalent measurement of cell respiratory control, which reports the rate of ATP production, the proton leak rate, the coupling efficiency, the maximum respiratory rate, the respiratory control ratio and the spare respiratory capacity. Measurements of membrane potential provide useful additional information. Measurement of both respiration and potential during appropriate titrations enables the identification of the primary sites of effectors and the distribution of control, allowing deeper quantitative analyses. Many other measurements in current use can be more problematic, as discussed in the present review.},

              ATP depletion and succinate accumulation during ischemia lead to oxidative damage to mammalian organs upon reperfusion. In contrast, freshwater turtles survive weeks of anoxia at low temperatures without suffering from oxidative damage upon reoxygenation, but the mechanisms are unclear. To determine how turtles survive prolonged anoxia, we measured {\textasciitilde}80 metabolites in hearts from cold-acclimated (5 $\,^{\circ}$C) turtles exposed to 9 days anoxia and compared the results with those for normoxic turtles (25 $\,^{\circ}$C) and mouse hearts exposed to 30 min of ischemia. In turtles, ATP and ADP decreased to new steady-state levels during fasting and cold-acclimation and further with anoxia, but disappeared within 30 min of ischemia in mouse hearts. High NADH/NAD
              +
              ratios were associated with succinate accumulation in both anoxic turtles and ischemic mouse hearts. However, succinate concentrations and succinate/fumarate ratios were lower in turtle than in mouse heart, limiting the driving force for production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon reoxygenation in turtles. Furthermore, we show production of ROS from succinate is prevented by re-synthesis of ATP from ADP. Thus, maintenance of an ATP/ADP pool and low succinate accumulation likely protects turtle hearts from anoxia/reoxygenation injury and suggests metabolic interventions as a therapeutic approach to limit ischemia/reperfusion injury in mammals.},

@article{castelli_cellular_2020,
	abstract = {Many reptiles and some fish determine offspring sex by environmental cues such as incubation temperature. The mechanism by which environmental signals are captured and transduced into specific sexual phenotypes has remained unexplained for over 50 years. Indeed, environmental sex determination (ESD) has been viewed as an intractable problem because sex determination is influenced by a myriad of genes that may be subject to environmental influence. Recent demonstrations of ancient, conserved epigenetic processes in the regulatory response to environmental cues suggest that the mechanisms of ESD have a previously unsuspected level of commonality, but the proximal sensor of temperature that ultimately gives rise to one sexual phenotype or the other remains unidentified. Here, we propose that in ESD species, environmental cues are sensed by the cell through highly conserved ancestral elements of calcium and redox (CaRe) status, then transduced to activate ubiquitous signal transduction pathways, or influence epigenetic processes, ultimately to drive the differential expression of sex genes. The early evolutionary origins of CaRe regulation, and its essential role in eukaryotic cell function, gives CaRe a propensity to be independently recruited for diverse roles as a `cellular sensor' of environmental conditions. Our synthesis provides the first cohesive mechanistic model connecting environmental signals and sex determination pathways in vertebrates, providing direction and a framework for developing targeted experimentation.},

@article{cossin-sevrin_effect_2022,
	abstract = {Developmental plasticity is partly mediated by transgenerational effects, including those mediated by the maternal endocrine system. Glucocorticoid and thyroid hormones may play central roles in developmental programming through their action on metabolism and growth. However, the mechanisms by which they affect growth and development remain understudied. One hypothesis is that maternal hormones directly affect the production and availability of energycarrying molecules (e.g. ATP) by their action on mitochondrial function. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally increased glucocorticoid and thyroid hormones in wild great tit eggs (Parus major) to investigate their impact on offspring mitochondrial aerobic metabolism (measured in blood cells), and subsequent growth and survival. We show that prenatal glucocorticoid supplementation affected offspring cellular aerobic metabolism by decreasing mitochondrial density, maximal mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, while increasing the proportion of the maximum capacity being used under endogenous conditions. Prenatal glucocorticoid supplementation only had mild effects on offspring body mass, size and condition during the rearing period, but led to a sex-specific (females only) decrease in body mass a few months after fledging. Contrary to our expectations, thyroid hormone supplementation did not affect offspring growth or mitochondrial metabolism. Recapture probability as juveniles or adults was not significantly affected by prenatal hormonal treatment. Our results demonstrate that prenatal glucocorticoids can affect post-natal mitochondrial density and aerobic metabolism. The weak effects on growth and apparent survival suggest that nestlings were mostly able to compensate for the transient decrease in mitochondrial aerobic metabolism induced by prenatal glucocorticoids.},

@article{da_mota_araujo_feeding_2021,
	abstract = {Snakes are interesting examples of taxa that can overcome energy metabolism challenges, as many species can endure long periods without feeding, and their eventual meals are of reasonably large sizes, thus exhibiting dual extreme adaptations. Consequently, metabolic rate increases considerably to attend to the energetic demand of digestion, absorption and protein synthesis. These animals should be adapted to transition from these two opposite states of energy fairly quickly, and therefore we investigated mitochondrial function plasticity in these states. Herein, we compared liver mitochondrial bioenergetics of the boid snake Boa constrictor during fasting and after meal intake. We fasted the snakes for 60 days, and then we fed a subgroup with 30\% of their body size and evaluated their maximum postprandial response. We measured liver respiration rates from permeabilized tissue and isolated mitochondria. From isolated mitochondria, we also measured Ca2+ retention capacity and redox status. Mitochondrial respiration rates were maximized after feeding, reaching an approximately 60\% increase from fasting levels when energized with complex I-linked substrates. Interestingly, fasting and fed snakes exhibited similar respiratory control ratios and citrate synthase activity. Furthermore, we found no differences in Ca2+ retention capacity, indicating no increase in susceptibility to mitochondrial permeability transition, and no changes in mitochondrial redox state, although fed animals exhibited increases in the release of H2O2. Thus, we conclude that liver mitochondria from B. constrictor snakes increase respiration rates during the postprandial period and quickly improve the bioenergetic capacity without compromising redox balance.},

@article{galli_beating_2013,
	abstract = {The freshwater turtle Trachemys scripta can survive in the complete absence of O2 (anoxia) for periods lasting several months. In mammals, anoxia leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, which culminates in cellular necrosis and apoptosis. Despite the obvious clinical benefits of understanding anoxia tolerance, little is known about the effects of chronic oxygen deprivation on the function of turtle mitochondria. In this study, we compared mitochondrial function in hearts of T. scripta exposed to either normoxia or 2weeks of complete anoxia at 5$\,^{\circ}$C and during simulated acute anoxia/reoxygenation. Mitochondrial respiration, electron transport chain activities, enzyme activities, proton conductance and membrane potential were measured in permeabilised cardiac fibres and isolated mitochondria. Two weeks of anoxia exposure at 5$\,^{\circ}$C resulted in an increase in lactate, and decreases in ATP, glycogen, pH and phosphocreatine in the heart. Mitochondrial proton conductance and membrane potential were similar between experimental groups, while aerobic capacity was dramatically reduced. The reduced aerobic capacity was the result of a severe downregulation of the F1FO-ATPase (Complex V), which we assessed as a decrease in enzyme activity. Furthermore, in stark contrast to mammalian paradigms, isolated turtle heart mitochondria endured 20min of anoxia followed by reoxygenation without any impact on subsequent ADP-stimulated O2 consumption (State III respiration) or State IV respiration. Results from this study demonstrate that turtle mitochondria remodel in response to chronic anoxia exposure and a reduction in Complex V activity is a fundamental component of mitochondrial and cellular anoxia survival.},

	abstract = {We investigated the effect of modifying fatty acid modification of heart mitochondrial membranes by dietary intervention on the functions and thermal sensitivity of electron transport system complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Four groups of rats were fed diets differing in their fat (coconut, olive or fish oil) and antioxidant (fish oil with or without probucol) contents. After 16 weeks of feeding, the coconut and olive oil groups had lower long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids contents and a lower unsaturation index compared to both fish oil groups. These differences in fatty acid composition were not related to any differences in the mitochondrial respiration rate induced at Complexes I, II or IV, or to differences in their thermal sensitivity. The coconut oil group showed a lower mitochondrial affinity for pyruvate at 5 $\,^{\circ}$C (kmapp = 6.4 $\pm$ 1.8) compared to any other groups (kmapp = 3.8 $\pm$ 0.5; 4.7 $\pm$ 0.8; 3.6 $\pm$ 1.1, for olive, fish oil and fish oil and probucol groups, respectively). At least in rat heart, our results do not support a major impact of the fatty acid composition of the mitochondrial membrane on the function of mitochondrial enzymatic complexes or on their temperature sensitivity.},

@article{martinez_reduced_2017,
	abstract = {The relationship between whole-organism growth and metabolism is generally assumed to be positive and causative; higher metabolic rates support higher growth rates. In Manduca sexta, existing data demonstrate a deviation from this simple prediction: at supraoptimal temperatures for larval growth, metabolic rate keeps increasing while growth rate is decreasing. This mismatch presumably reflects the rising ``cost of maintenance'' with temperature. Precisely what constitutes this cost is not clear, but we suspect the efficiency with which mitochondria harness oxygen and organic substrates into cellular energy (ATP) is key. We tested this by integrating existing data on M. sexta growth and metabolism with new data on mitochondrial bioenergetics across the temperature range 147--427C. Across this range, our measure of mitochondrial efficiency closely paralleled larval growth rates. At supraoptimal temperatures for growth, mitochondrial efficiency was reduced, which could explain the mismatch between growth and metabolism observed at the whole-organism level.},

@article{michaelsen_high_2021,
	abstract = {Mitochondria provide cellular energy through oxidative phosphorylation, and thus temperature-induced constraints on mitochondrial function may be crucial to animal aerobic scope and thermal tolerance. Here, we report the effect of temperature in the range 5--30$\,^{\circ}$C on respiration rates of isolated cardiac mitochondria from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) studied by high-resolution respirometry and spectrophotometric enzyme activity assays. Arrhenius breakpoint temperature analysis indicated that mitochondrial respiration rates under phosphorylating and fully uncoupled conditions increased exponentially up to 20$\,^{\circ}$C, but stopped increasing at higher temperatures. In contrast, respiration rates measured under non-phosphorylating leak conditions continued to increase up to 30$\,^{\circ}$C. The decrease in the ratio between phosphorylating and uncoupled respiration at high temperature indicated that phosphorylation was gradually impaired with increasing temperature, possibly because of the steadily increasing proton leak across the membrane. In addition, we found that complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) activity decreased above 20$\,^{\circ}$C, similarly to mitochondrial respiration, and that complex I was unstable in the presence of detergents, suggesting that it may be particularly sensitive to changes in its interaction with membrane phospholipids. In contrast, complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) maintained activity at temperatures above 20$\,^{\circ}$C, although succinate oxidation was insufficient to compensate for the loss of complex I activity in intact mitochondria. Together, these results indicate that the temperatureinduced decrease in cardiac mitochondrial function coincides with the temperature at which trout aerobic scope peaks, and is largely due to impaired phosphorylation and complex I activity.},

To investigate the consequence of overriding uniparental inheritance, we generated mice containing an admixture (heteroplasmy) of NZB and 129S6 mtDNAs in the presence of a congenic C57BL/6J nuclear background. Analysis of the segregation of the two mtDNAs across subsequent maternal generations revealed that proportion of NZB mtDNA was preferentially reduced. Ultimately, this segregation process produced NZB-129 heteroplasmic mice and their NZB or 129 mtDNA homoplasmic counterparts. Phenotypic comparison of these three mtDNA lines demonstrated that the NZB-129 heteroplasmic mice, but neither homoplasmic counterpart, had reduced activity, food intake, respiratory exchange ratio; accentuated stress response; and cognitive impairment. Therefore, admixture of two normal but different mouse mtDNAs can be genetically unstable and can produce adverse physiological effects, factors that may explain the advantage of uniparental inheritance of mtDNA.},

@article{sun_motile_2013,
	abstract = {One of the most notable characteristics of synaptic transmission is the wide variation in synaptic strength in response to identical stimulation. In hippocampal neurons, approximately one-third of axonal mitochondria are highly motile, and some dynamically pass through presynaptic boutons. This raises a fundamental question: can motile mitochondria contribute to the pulse-to-pulse variability of presynaptic strength? Recently, we identified syntaphilin as an axonal mitochondrial-docking protein. Using hippocampal neurons and slices of syntaphilin knockout mice, we demonstrate that the motility of axonal mitochondria correlates with presynaptic variability. Enhancing mitochondrial motility increases the pulse-to-pulse variability, whereas immobilizing mitochondria reduces the variability. By dual-color live imaging at single-bouton levels, we further show that motile mitochondria passing through boutons dynamically influence synaptic vesicle release, mainly by altering ATP homeostasis in axons. Thus, our study provides insight into the fundamental properties of the CNS to ensure the plasticity and reliability of synaptic transmission.},

@article{blier_holding_2014,
	abstract = {Changes in environmental temperature can pose considerable challenges to animals and shifts in thermal habitat have been shown to be a major force driving species' adaptation. These adaptations have been the focus of major research efforts to determine the physiological or metabolic constraints related to temperature and to reveal the phenotypic characters that can or should adjust. Considering the current consensus on climate change, the focus of research will likely shift to questioning whether ectothermic organisms will be able to survive future modifications of their thermal niches. Organisms can adjust to temperature changes through physiological plasticity (e.g., acclimation), genetic adaptation, or via dispersal to more suitable thermal habitats. Thus, it is important to understand what genetic and phenotypic attributes---at the individual, population, and species levels---could improve survival success. These issues are particularly important for ectotherms, which are in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding environment. To start addressing these queries, we should consider what physiological or metabolic functions are responsible for the impact of temperature on organisms. Some recent developments indicate that mitochondria are key metabolic structures determining the thermal range that an organism can tolerate. The catalytic capacity of mitochondria is highly sensitive to thermal variation and therefore should partly dictate the temperature dependence of biological functions. Mitochondria contain a complex network of different enzymatic reaction pathways that interact synergistically. The precise regulation of both adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production depends on the integration of different enzymes and pathways. Here, we examine the temperature dependence of different parts of mitochondrial pathways and evaluate the evolutionary challenges that need to be overcome to ensure mitochondrial adaptations to new thermal environments.},

	abstract = {Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are widely used animal models. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying hypoxia tolerance in this species have remained poorly understood. In the present study, we have determined the effects of hypoxia on blood-O2 transport properties and mitochondrial respiration rate in permeabilized muscle fibres of adult zebrafish exposed to either 1) a gradual decrease in O2 levels until fish lost equilibrium ({\textasciitilde}1 h, acute hypoxia), or 2) severe hypoxia (PO2 ∼ 15 Torr) for 48 h (prolonged hypoxia). Acute, short-term hypoxia caused an increase in hemoglobin (Hb) O2 affinity (decrease in P50), due to a decrease in erythrocyte ATP after erythrocyte swelling. No changes in isoHb expression patterns were observed between hypoxic and normoxic treatments. Prolonged hypoxia elicited additional reponses on O2 consumption: lactate accumulated in the blood, indicating that zebrafish relied on glycolysis for ATP production, and mitochondrial respiration of skeletal muscle was overall significantly inhibited. In addition, male zebrafish had higher hypoxia tolerance (measured as time to loss of equilibrium) than females. The present study contributes to our understanding of the adaptive mechanisms that allow zebrafish, and by inference other fish species, to cope with low O2 levels.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Human and nonhuman primates are vulnerable to age- and menopause-related decline in working memory, a cognitive function reliant on the energy-demanding excitation of prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons. The number and strength of presynaptic boutons providing inputs to these PFC neurons regulate their excitability. We show that poor working memory in rhesus monkeys is associated with a higher incidence of presynaptic boutons harboring malformed, donut-shaped mitochondria that form abnormally small synaptic contacts. Surgically induced menopause results in working memory impairment and a concomitant increase in presynaptic donut-shaped mitochondria, both of which are reversed by estradiol treatment. Our findings suggest that hormone replacement therapy benefits cognitive aging, in part, by promoting mitochondrial and synaptic health in the PFC.

              Humans and nonhuman primates are vulnerable to age- and menopause-related decline in working memory, a cognitive function reliant on the energy-demanding recurrent excitation of neurons within Brodmann's Area 46 of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Here, we tested the hypothesis that the number and morphology (straight, curved, or donut-shaped) of mitochondria in dlPFC presynaptic boutons are altered with aging and menopause in rhesus monkeys (
              Macaca mulatta
              ) and that these metrics correlate with delayed response (DR) accuracy, a well-characterized measure of dlPFC-dependent working memory. Although presynaptic bouton density or size was not significantly different across groups distinguished by age or menses status, DR accuracy correlated positively with the number of total and straight mitochondria per dlPFC bouton. In contrast, DR accuracy correlated inversely with the frequency of boutons containing donut-shaped mitochondria, which exhibited smaller active zone areas and fewer docked synaptic vesicles than those with straight or curved mitochondria. We then examined the effects of estrogen administration to test whether a treatment known to improve working memory influences mitochondrial morphology. Aged ovariectomized monkeys treated with vehicle displayed significant working memory impairment and a concomitant 44\% increase in presynaptic donut-shaped mitochondria, both of which were reversed with cyclic estradiol treatment. Together, our data suggest that hormone replacement therapy may benefit cognitive aging, in part by promoting mitochondrial and synaptic health in the dlPFC.},

In order to identify which step in the process was most sensitive to temperature in a cold-temperate ectothermic species, we measured the thermal sensitivity of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, as well as the thermal sensitivity of each individual step in this process, in mitochondria isolated from the heart of Atlantic wolffish (Anarhichas lupus). The thermal sensitivity of oxidative phosphorylation (coupled, ADP-stimulated), measured in the presence of pyruvate and malate as substrates, and those of Complexes II and IV activities were the same over the whole range of assay temperatures (5 to 35 $\,^{\circ}$C). In contrast, the thermal sensitivity of Complexes I and III, ATPase, pyruvate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase could not be correlated with the thermal sensitivity of oxidative phosphorylation. The first step in the process of oxidative phosphorylation to be negatively affected by increased temperature was shown to be Complex III, followed by the Complex I. This occurred at temperatures above the tolerance limit and well above the range of temperatures occupied by the species. Our results identify specific steps within the electron transport system as potential control point limiting the capacity of Atlantic wolffish cardiac mitochondrial metabolism in response to changes in temperature.},

Higher metabolic rates generate increased maintenance energy costs which are a major component of energy budgets. Organisms often employ plastic or evolutionary (e.g., local adaptation) mechanisms to optimize metabolic rate with respect to their environment. We examined relationships between temperature and standard metabolic rate across four populations of a widespread amphibian species to determine if populations vary in metabolic response and if their metabolic rates are plastic to seasonal thermal cues. Populations from warmer climates lowered metabolic rates when acclimating to summer temperatures as compared to spring temperatures. This may act as an energy saving mechanism during the warmest time of the year. No such plasticity was evident in populations from cooler climates. Both juvenile and adult salamanders exhibited metabolic plasticity. Although some populations responded to historic climate thermal cues, no populations showed plastic metabolic rate responses to future climate temperatures, indicating there are constraints on plastic responses. We postulate that impacts of warming will likely impact the energy budgets of salamanders, potentially affecting key demographic rates, such as individual growth and investment in reproduction.},

However, there exists great variation both in the duration and magnitude of HIF. In insects, HIF is well known, and it appears to be dramatic, especially in immature stages. However, little is known about the effect of HIF on different aspects of metabolism. We determined metabolic rate as CO2 production in fasted and non-fasted nymphs of the sand cricket (Gryllus firmus). A number of metabolic variables were computed from the simultaneous activity record: activity, resting, minimum, maximum and average metabolic rate. Our results suggest that there is a general effect of fasting in metabolic rate but with a graded response: the larger the influence of activity on the metabolic variable, the less is the effect of fasting that was detected.},

@article{salin_inadequate_2016,
	abstract = {Animals, especially ectotherms, are highly sensitive to the temperature of their surrounding environment. Extremely high temperature, for example, induces a decline of average performance of conspecifics within a population, but individual heterogeneity in the ability to cope with elevating temperatures has rarely been studied. Here, we examined inter-individual variation in feeding ability and consequent growth rate of juvenile brown trout Salmo trutta acclimated to a high temperature (19$\,^{\circ}$C), and investigated the relationship between these metrics of whole-animal performances and among-individual variation in mitochondrial respiration capacity. Food was provided ad libitum, yet intake varied ten-fold amongst individuals, resulting in some fish losing weight whilst others continued to grow. Almost half of the variation in food intake was related to variability in mitochondrial capacity: low intake (and hence growth failure) was associated with high leak respiration rates within liver and muscle mitochondria, and a lower coupling of muscle mitochondria. These observations, combined with the inability of fish with low food consumption to increase their intake despite ad libitum food levels, suggest a possible insufficient capacity of the mitochondria for maintaining ATP homeostasis. Individual variation in thermal performance is likely to confer variation in the upper limit of an organism's thermal niche and might affect the structure of wild populations in warming environments.},

@article{stier_mitochondrial_2014,
	abstract = {Mitochondria have a fundamental role in the transduction of energy from food into ATP. The coupling between food oxidation and ATP production is never perfect, but may nevertheless be of evolutionary significance. The `uncoupling to survive' hypothesis suggests that `mild' mitochondrial uncoupling evolved as a protective mechanism against the excessive production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS). Because resource allocation and ROS production are thought to shape animal life histories, alternative life-history trajectories might be driven by individual variation in the degree of mitochondrial uncoupling. We tested this hypothesis in a small bird species, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), by treating adults with the artificial mitochondrial uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) over a 32-month period. In agreement with our expectations, the uncoupling treatment increased metabolic rate. However, we found no evidence that treated birds enjoyed lower oxidative stress levels or greater survival rates, in contrast to previous results in other taxa. In vitro experiments revealed lower sensitivity of ROS production to DNP in mitochondria isolated from skeletal muscles of zebra finch than mouse. In addition, we found significant reductions in the number of eggs laid and in the inflammatory immune response in treated birds. Altogether, our data suggest that the `uncoupling to survive' hypothesis may not be applicable for zebra finches, presumably because of lower effects of mitochondrial uncoupling on mitochondrial ROS production in birds than in mammals. Nevertheless, mitochondrial uncoupling appeared to be a potential life-history regulator of traits such as fecundity and immunity at adulthood, even with food supplied ad libitum.},

While it is becoming clear that telomere length is influenced by prenatal conditions, the factors affecting telomere dynamics during embryogenesis remain poorly understood. We manipulated both the pace and stability of embryonic development through varying incubation temperature and its stability in Japanese quail. We investigated the impact on telomere dynamics from embryogenesis to adulthood, together with three potential drivers of telomere shortening, growth rate, oxidative damage and prenatal glucocorticoid levels. Telomere length was not affected by our prenatal manipulation for the first 75\% of embryogenesis, but was reduced at hatching in groups experiencing faster (i.e. high temperature) or less stable embryonic development. These early life differences in telomere length persisted until adulthood. The effect of developmental instability on telomere length at hatching was potentially mediated by an increased secretion of glucocorticoid hormones during development. Both the pace and the stability of embryo development appear to be key factors determining telomere length and dynamics into adulthood, with fast and less stable development leading to shorter telomeres, with the potential for adverse associated outcomes in terms of reduced longevity.},

	abstract = {Stress hormones and their impacts on whole organism metabolic rates are usually considered as appropriate proxies for animal energy budget that is the foundation of numerous concepts and models aiming at predicting individual and population responses to environmental stress. However, the dynamics of energy re-allocation under stress make the link between metabolism and corticosterone complex and still unclear. Using ectopic application of corticosterone for 3, 11 and 21 days, we estimated a time effect of stress in a lizard (Zootoca vivipara). We then investigated whole organism metabolism, muscle cellular -O2 consumption and liver mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation processes -(O2 consumption and ATP production) and ROS production. The data showed that while skeletal muscle is not impacted, stress regulates the liver mitochondrial functionality in a time-dependent manner with opposing pictures between the different time expositions to corticosterone. While 3 days exposition is characterized by lower ATP synthesis rate and high H- 2O2 release with no change in the rate of oxygen consumption, the 11 days exposition reduced all three fluxes of about 50\%. Oxidative phosphorylation capacities in liver mitochondria of lizard treated with corticosterone for 21 days was similar to the hepatic mitochondrial capacities in lizards that received no corticosterone treatment but with 40\% decrease in H- 2O2 production. This new mitochondrial functioning allows a better capacity to respond to the energetic demands imposed by the environment but do not influence whole organism metabolism. In conclusion, global mitochondrial functioning has to be considered to better understand the proximal causes of the energy budget under stressful periods.},

Meta-analysis is the term used to describe the carrying out of statistical analysis of the combination of the results of two or more original studies, which had to be selected from a systematic review. In this way, a meta-analysis cannot exist without a systematic review. Systematic reviews arise due to the exponential increase in the information; to provide all health personnel with a study that critically analyzes the results and discriminates those that may be useful in clinical practice. Systematic reviews are one of the fundamental tools in evidence-based medicine, in which two of the main steps refer to both the search and the critical analysis of the studies, which shall support medical decisions on aspects that are mainly related to diagnosis, treatment, or prognosis. On the other hand, systematic reviews have been essential for some time now when developing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and they can be used to make decisions on health policies. The methodology for performing and interpreting systematic reviews and meta-analysis is described in this article.},

The overall conclusions of a meta-analysis, however, depend heavily on the quality of the meta-analytic process, and an appropriate evaluation of the quality of metaanalysis (meta-evaluation) can be challenging. We outline ten questions biologists can ask to critically appraise a meta-analysis. These questions could also act as simple and accessible guidelines for the authors of meta-analyses. We focus on meta-analyses using nonhuman species, which we term `biological' metaanalysis. Our ten questions are aimed at enabling a biologist to evaluate whether a biological meta-analysis embodies `mega-enlightenment', a `mega-mistake', or something in between.},

@article{hyde_two_2011,
	abstract = {Studies of human adults, infants, and non-human animals demonstrate that non-symbolic numerical cognition is supported by at least two distinct cognitive systems: a ``parallel individuation system'' that encodes the numerical identity of individual items and an ``approximate number system'' that encodes the approximate numerical magnitude, or numerosity, of a set. The exact nature and role of these systems, however, have been debated for over a 100-years. Some argue that the non-symbolic representation of small numbers ({\textless}4) is carried out solely by the parallel individuation system and the non-symbolic representation of large numbers ({\textgreater}4) is carried out solely by the approximate number system. Others argue that all numbers are represented by the approximate number system. This debate has been fueled largely by some studies showing dissociations between small and large number processing and other studies showing similar processing of small and large numbers. Recent work has addressed this debate by showing that the two systems are present and distinct from early infancy, persist despite the acquisition of a symbolic number system, activate distinct cortical networks, and engage differentially based attentional constraints. Based on the recent discoveries, I provide a hypothesis that may explain the puzzling findings and makes testable predictions as to when each system will be engaged. In particular, when items are presented under conditions that allow selection of individuals, they will be represented as distinct mental items through parallel individuation and not as a numerical magnitude. In contrast, when items are presented outside attentional limits (e.g., too many, too close together, under high attentional load), they will be represented as a single mental numerical magnitude and not as distinct mental items. These predictions provide a basis on which researchers can further investigate the role of each system in the development of uniquely human numerical thought.},

Differentiating between more and less amounts might be adaptative in different contexts such as in social relationships, navigation, or foraging. However, feeding close to conspecifics might change foraging behavior decisions due to changes in predation risk perception and competition for resources. Here, we tested the quantity judgment abilities of foraging rock lizards (Iberolacerta cyreni) in a spontaneous choice test between 5 and 10 cricket prey. Lizards tested had been previously housed alone or in a group to examine how social experience affected foraging decisions. Our results showed that ``grouped'' lizards had greater foraging activity than ``solitary'' lizards. Furthermore, all lizards demonstrated some ability to discriminate between the two amounts of prey. These results reveal the capability of quantity judgments in rock lizards and also that foraging decisions may be modulated by the previous social experience.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            While foraging or during social interactions, animals may benefit from judging relative quantity. Individuals may select larger prey or a patch with more food and, likewise, it may pay to track the number and type of individuals and social interactions. We tested for spontaneous quantity discrimination in the gidgee skink (Egernia stokesii), a family-living lizard. Lizards were presented with food quantities differing in number or size and were able to select the larger quantity of food items when they differed in number but not when items differed in size. We show, for the first time, superior spontaneous discrimination of items differing in number over size in a lizard species, which contrasts with previous findings. Our simple method, however, did not include controls for the use of continuous quantities, and further tests are required to determine the role of such information during quantity discrimination. Our results provide support for the use of the parallel individuation system for the discrimination of small quantities (four or fewer items). Lizards might, however, still use the approximate number system if items in larger quantities (more than four) are presented. Overall, we uncovered evidence that species might possess specific cognitive abilities potentially adapted to their niche with respect to quantity information (discrete and/or continuous) and the processing system used when judging quantities. Importantly, our results highlight the need for testing multiple species using similar testing procedures to gain a better understanding of the underlying causes leading to differences across species.},

For scientists themselves, effect sizes are most useful because they facilitate cumulative science. Effect sizes can be used to determine the sample size for follow-up studies, or examining effects across studies. This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA's such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between withinand between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workflow.},

@article{casagrande_telomere_2019,
	abstract = {Stress exposure can leave long-term footprints within the organism, like in telomeres (TLs), protective chromosome caps that shorten during cell replication and following exposure to stressors. Short TLs are considered to indicate lower fitness prospects, but why TLs shorten under stressful conditions is not understood. Glucocorticoid hormones (GCs) increase upon stress exposure and are thought to promote TL shortening by increasing oxidative damage. However, evidence that GCs are pro-oxidants and oxidative stress is causally linked to TL attrition is mixed
              .
              Based on new biochemical findings, we propose the
              metabolic telomere attrition
              hypothesis: during times of substantially increased energy demands, TLs are shortened as part of the transition into an organismal `emergency state', which prioritizes immediate survival functions over processes with longer-term benefits. TL attrition during energy shortages could serve multiple roles including amplified signalling of cellular energy debt to re-direct critical resources to immediately important processes. This new view of TL shortening as a strategy to resolve major energetic trade-offs can improve our understanding of TL dynamics. We suggest that TLs are master regulators of cell homeostasis and propose future research avenues to understand the interactions between energy homeostasis, metabolic regulators and TL.},

@techreport{andreassen_brain_2020,
	abstract = {Understanding the physiological mechanisms that limit animal thermal tolerance is crucial in predicting how animals will respond to increasingly severe heatwaves. Despite its importance for understanding climate change impacts, these mechanisms underlying the upper thermal tolerance limits of animals are largely unknown. It has been hypothesised that the upper thermal tolerance in fish is limited by the thermal tolerance of the brain and that it is ultimately caused by a global brain depolarization. In this study, we developed methods for measuring the upper thermal limit (CTmax) in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) with simultaneous recordings of brain activity using GCaMP6s calcium imaging in both freeswimming and agar-embedded fish. We discovered that during warming, CTmax precedes, and is therefore not caused by, a global brain depolarization. Instead, the CTmax coincides with a decline in spontaneous neural activity and a loss of neural response to visual stimuli. By manipulating water oxygen levels, we found that oxygen availability during heating affects both locomotor-related neural activity, the neural response to visual stimuli, and CTmax. Our results suggest that the mechanism limiting the upper thermal tolerance in zebrafish larvae is reduced oxygen availability causing impaired brain function.},

	abstract = {Stressful environments in utero can have a profound influence on cognitive functions and learning ability. In lizards, thermal environments experienced by embryos can shape a range of traits, including sex, body size, and locomotor performance, which may influence fitness. Recent studies suggest that incubation temperatures may also influence brain development and learning ability of some lizard species. Therefore, predicted increases in nest temperatures of lizards may not only affect hatchling morphology and performance, but could also affect their learning ability. To investigate how incubation temperatures influence cognitive abilities of hatchlings, we incubated eggs of the velvet gecko, Amalosia lesueurii, under two fluctuating temperature regimes. The warm treatment mimicked the thermal profiles of currently used partly shaded communal nests (mean = 24.3 $\,^{\circ}$C, range 18.4--31.1 $\,^{\circ}$C), and the hot treatment simulated thermal profiles that could be experienced in sun-exposed nests in 2050 (mean = 28.9 $\,^{\circ}$C, range 19.1--38.1 $\,^{\circ}$C). At age three to four weeks, we measured the ability of hatchlings to locate an open shelter in a Y-maze choice test. Both hot and warm-incubated hatchlings successfully learned the task, but hatchlings from the warm-temperature treatment learned the task faster, and made fewer mistakes in the first five trials than hot-incubated hatchlings. These patterns were consistent for hatchlings from two geographic locations, suggesting that thermally stressful conditions in utero may alter the learning abilities of hatchling lizards. Because learning ability can affect the survival of hatchling velvet geckos, future increase in nest temperatures may have wide reaching impacts on populations.},

	abstract = {The thermal environment within a reptile nest can affect the phenotypic traits of hatchlings, and hence (potentially) their fitness. Research on this topic needs to measure phenotypic traits relevant to the species involved; and hence, studies on unusual species need to measure unusual traits. We investigated the effects of two incubation temperatures on the morphology and behaviour of hatchling veiled chameleons (Chamaeleo calyptratus). Colder-incubated eggs exhibited a longer incubation period, but produced larger faster-growing hatchlings. Incubation treatment also affected a chameleon's activity level and its unique foraging tactics. Cold-incubated animals were more sedentary, caught prey faster, and extended their tongues farther to reach prey than did their warm-incubated counterparts. Thus, the fitness costs of low temperatures in the nest (slow development, and thus late hatching) may be offset by incubation-derived enhancements in hatchling growth rates and foraging abilities.},

	abstract = {Early developmental temperatures influence the physiology and behavior of reptiles, with important consequences for their fitness and survival. For example, many viviparous lizards are cold adapted which may restrict their activity times during the reproductive season, increasing their susceptibility to global warming. However, it is unclear if and how lizards with different reproductive modes (oviparity vs. viviparity) can respond to rising temperatures by modifying their life-history traits. We examined the effect of developmental temperatures on hatchling behavior and learning in viviparous and oviparous populations of the lizard Saiphos equalis to test whether their reproductive behavior can buffer against rising temperatures. Gravid females from both populations were subjected to current or projected end-of-century (future) thermal environments to evaluate differences in the exploratory, foraging and antipredator behavior, and spatial learning ability of their offspring. We found that viviparous lizards were more exploratory and had a less-pronounced antipredator response than oviparous lizards. Regardless of the mode of reproduction, elevated temperatures reduced the exploratory behavior of hatchling lizards. Elevated temperatures also reduced the foraging efficiency of oviparous, but not viviparous, hatchlings. Finally, future-gestated oviparous hatchlings were more likely to choose the correct refuge and made fewer mistakes in a spatial learning task; however, we found only weak evidence of spatial learning in S. equalis. Our results suggest that although global warming is likely to have a negative impact on phenotypic traits, in S. equalis, some of these effects may be ameliorated by maternal behavior and/or physiological responses during pregnancy, particularly in viviparous populations.},

	abstract = {Many ectothermic animals are subject to fluctuating environmental temperatures during incubation as well as post-birth. Numerous studies examined the effects of incubation temperature or ambient temperature on various aspects of offspring phenotype. We investigated whether incubation temperature and ambient temperature have an interactive effect on offspring performance. Our study animal, the ectothermic vertebrate Lampropholis delicata (common garden skink; De Vis 1888), experiences fluctuating environmental temperatures caused by differential invasion of an exotic plant Vinca major (blue periwinkle). In the laboratory, eggs from wild-caught females were assigned to different incubation temperatures that mimicked variation in natural nests. The feeding performance and digestion time of each hatchling was tested at ambient temperatures that represented environments invaded to different degrees by periwinkle. Incubation and ambient temperature interacted to affect a lizard's mobility, the time that it took to capture, subdue and handle a prey, and the number of handling `errors' that it made while foraging. For a number of these characteristics, incubation-induced changes to a lizard's mass significantly affected this relationship. Irrespective of size, no interaction effect was found for digestion time: lizards digested food faster at warmer temperatures, regardless of incubation temperature. Thus, temperatures experienced during incubation may alter an animal's phenotype so that the surrounding thermal environment differentially affects aspects of feeding performance. Our results also demonstrate that incubation environment can induce changes to morphology and behaviour that carry over into a lizard's early life, and that in some cases these differences in phenotype interact to affect performance. We suggest that the immediate removal of exotic plants as part of a weed control strategy could have important implications for the foraging performance, and presumably fitness, of ectothermic animals.},

	abstract = {Nest-site selection is the only behaviour that can be considered parental care in most oviparous reptiles because eggs are abandoned after laying and because incubation conditions resulting from nest-site selection can have profound effects on offspring. During a 7-year study of black rat snakes, Elaphe obsoleta (Say in James, 1823), we investigated phenotypic effects of incubation temperature on hatchlings, monitored temperatures in nests, and determined the preferred nesting temperature. Temperatures of communal nests were higher than those of single-female nests. In the laboratory, females preferred to nest at temperatures most similar to those of communal nests. Hatchlings from eggs incubated at temperatures similar to those in the warmer communal nests hatched faster, were longer, swam faster, were less aggressive, and had fewer scale anomalies than hatchlings from eggs incubated at temperatures similar to those in single nests. A possible disadvantage of communal nests is that eggs in communal nests may be at greater risk to parasitism by Nicrophorus pustulatus (Herschel, 1807). The incubation experiment allowed a test of a key assumption of a model proposed to explain environmental sex determination. Contrary to that assumption, we found no evidence that incubation temperature affected males and females differently. Our results might explain why temperaturedependent sex determination appears not to occur in snakes.},

	abstract = {Eggs of wall lizards (Podarcis muralis) were incubated at three temperatures approaching the upper limit of viability for embryonic development in this species (26, 29, and 32$\,^{\circ}$C) to assess the influence of temperature on various aspects of hatchling phenotype likely affecting fitness. The thermal environment affected size and several morphometric characteristics of hatchling lizards. Hatchlings from eggs incubated at 32$\,^{\circ}$C were smaller (snout-vent length, SVL) than those from 26 and 29$\,^{\circ}$C and had smaller mass residuals (from the regression on SVL) as well as shorter tail, head, and femur relative to SVL. Variation in the level of fluctuating asymmetry in meristic and morphometric traits associated with incubation temperatures was quite high but not clearly consistent with the prediction that environmental stress associated with the highest incubation temperatures might produce the highest level of asymmetry. When tested for locomotor capacity in trials developed at body temperatures of 32 and 35$\,^{\circ}$C, hatchlings from the 32$\,^{\circ}$C incubation treatment exhibited the worst performance in any aspect considered (burst speed, maximal length, and number of stops in the complete run). Repeated measures ANCOVAs (with initial egg mass as covariate) of snout-vent length and mass of lizards at days 0 and 20 revealed significant effects of incubation temperature only for mass, being again the hatchlings from eggs incubated at 32$\,^{\circ}$C those exhibiting the smallest final size. All together, our results evidenced a pervasive effect of thermal regime during incubation (and hence of nest site selection) on hatchling phenotypes. However, incubation temperature does not affect hatchling phenotypes in a continuous way; for most of the analysed traits a critical threshold seems to exist between 29 and 32$\,^{\circ}$C, so that hatchlings incubated at 32$\,^{\circ}$C exhibited major detrimental effects.

	abstract = {All animals that are exposed to predators must distinguish dangerous from nondangerous threats and respond correctly. In reptiles, emerging hatchlings are vulnerable to a wide range of predators, particularly if they emerge during daylight. In these experiments I tested the response of pine snake, Pituophis melanoleucus, hatchlings incubated at 22--23, 27--28, or 32--33 C to visual and vibratory stimuli to examine antipredator behaviour. Emerging hatchlings were exposed to one of five conditions: (1) hawk model, (2) white head model with no facial features, (3) white head model with black eyes, (4) a person, or (5) a vibration without a visual stimulus. I tested the null hypotheses of no differences in response as a function of predator type or incubation temperature. Emergence behaviour when undisturbed was affected by incubating temperature, and antipredatory behaviour was affected by both predator type and incubation temperature. Pine snake hatchlings responded more protectively (withdrawal into tunnels) than defensively (striking), responded with less intensity to a vibration compared with visual predator stimuli, and required longer to respond to a head model without eyes than to all other predator types. Given the relatively small size of hatchlings, it is adaptive for them to withdraw into the nest rather than attack a predator. Hatchlings from eggs that were incubated at medium temperatures required less time to emerge from their underground nests when undisturbed, and had stronger protective responses than snakes incubated at other temperatures. These results suggest that hatchlings incubated at medium temperatures are generally less vulnerable to predators than hatchlings incubated at higher or lower temperatures.},

	abstract = {Incubation temperature in ectothermic vertebrates aects incubation periods, and in some reptiles it aects sex ratios and behavior. I present evidence that incubation temperature aects emergence and post-hatching behavior of pine snakes (Pituophis melanoleucus) that could in¯uence survival in the weeks before hibernation. Hatchlings incubated at low temperatures remained in the nest longer, had fewer alternate nest openings, and fewer underground tunnels to hide in than did hatchlings from warmer temperatures. These conditions could render hatchlings from lowtemperature nests more vulnerable to predation because, if a nest is opened, they are not inside tunnels where they would be protected. Hatchlings from nests incubated at low temperatures took longer to {\textregistered}nd shade during a thermoregulation test, and were less likely to move about in search of other cover than were those from higher-incubation-temperature arti{\textregistered}cial nests. Similarly, hatchlings from nests with low incubation temperatures were less responsive to a predatory stimulus and had a longer latency to strike than other hatchlings. Taken together, hatchlings from nests with low incubation temperatures might be less able to avoid predators and {\textregistered}nd shade than those from nests incubated at higher temperatures, and thus could be expected to have lower survival in nature.},

	abstract = {Incubation temperature is one of the most studied factors driving phenotypic plasticity in oviparous reptiles. We examined how incubation temperature influenced hatchling morphology, thermal preference and temperature-dependent running speed in the small Australian agamid lizard Amphibolurus muricatus. Hatchlings incubated at 32 1C grew more slowly than those incubated at 25 and 28 1C during their first month after hatching, and tended to be smaller at one month. These differences were no longer significant by three months of age due to selective mortality of the smallest hatchlings. The cooler incubation treatments (25 1C and 28 1C) produced lizards that had deeper and wider heads. Hatchlings from 28 1C had cooler and more stable temperature preferences, and also had lower body temperatures during a 2-h thermoregulatory behaviour trial. Locomotor performance was enhanced at higher body temperatures, but incubation temperature had no measurable effect either independently or in interaction with body temperature. Our study demonstrates that incubation temperature has direct effects on morphology and thermoregulatory behaviour that appears to be independent of any sizedependent effects. We postulate a mechanistic link between these two effects.},

	abstract = {Incubation temperature has significant developmental effects on oviparous animals, including affecting sexual differentiation for several species. Incubation temperature also affects traits that can influence survival, a theory that is verified in this study for the Northwest Atlantic loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta). We conducted controlled laboratory incubations and experiments to test for an effect of incubation temperature on performance of loggerhead hatchlings. Sixty-eight hatchlings were tested in 2011, and 31 in 2012, produced from eggs incubated at 11 different constant temperatures ranging from 27˚C to 33˚C. Following their emergence from the eggs, we tested righting response, crawling speed, and conducted a 24-hour long swim test. The results support previous studies on sea turtle hatchlings, with an effect of incubation temperature seen on survivorship, righting response time, crawling speed, change in crawl speed, and overall swim activity, and with hatchlings incubated at 27˚C showing decreased locomotor abilities. No hatchlings survived to be tested in both years when incubated at 32˚C and above. Differences in survivorship of hatchlings incubated at high temperatures are important in light of projected higher sand temperatures due to climate change, and could indicate increased mortality from incubation temperature effects.},

@article{freedberg_developmental_nodate,
	abstract = {Charnov and Bull (1977) originally predicted that environmental sex determination (ESD) can evolve when the developmental environment differentially affects male and female fitness. While developmental temperature is known to affect hatchling performance in reptiles with ESD, this reaction norm can provide the conditions to favour ESD only if the effects are long-lasting. We incubated eggs of Graptemys ouachitensis, an emydid turtle with ESD, at temperatures previously found to affect hatchling righting response. We tested righting response in both hatchlings and turtles raised in the laboratory for 1 year, and also examined the effects of testing temperature and social interactions on righting response. Turtles incubated at 30ЊC righted more quickly than turtles incubated at 25ЊC both as hatchlings and yearlings, and this effect was robust to testing temperature or rearing conditions. We found a similar reaction norm of temperature on righting response in Trachemys scripta elegans, another emydid turtle with ESD. These results demonstrate that incubation temperature can have long-lasting effects on performance in reptiles with ESD, and may provide the conditions required to favour the evolution of ESD.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic integration, in which a suite of traits change in a correlated or covarying response to shifts in environmental conditions, may enhance an organism's fitness. In skinks, rocky environments select for longer limbs and rapid running and climbing. We examined whether differences in nest temperature coincident with specific habitats caused phenotypically integrated effects on morphology, locomotor performance, and behavior in the skink Carlia longipes. Specifically, we determined whether microhabitat choices were integrated with adaptive morphology for each habitat. Using a split-clutch design, we incubated eggs at thermal regimes that mimicked the thermal environments of nests from two habitat types (forest p warm; rocky p cool). Hatchlings from cool incubation environments had longer limbs and greater running and climbing speeds, which are likely to be beneficial for rocky habitats. In addition, individuals from cool incubation environments selected rocky microhabitats more frequently than did hatchlings from warm incubation environments. We demonstrate phenotypic integration in response to nest temperature that affected morphology, performance, and ultimately habitat selection in a way that should increase hatchling fitness.},

However, the effects of abnormal incubation temperatures are subtle and not well documented. Here we show that short-term learning and memory abilities of adult workers are affected by the temperature they experienced during pupal development. In contrast, long-term learning and memory is not significantly affected by rearing temperature. Furthermore, we could detect no effects of incubation temperature on fluctuating asymmetry, as a measure of developmental stability, in workers, queens or drones. We conclude that the most important consequence of abnormal rearing temperatures are subtle neural deficiencies affecting short-term memory rather than physical abnormalities.},

@article{lowenborg_fitness_2011,
	abstract = {Phenotypic traits of hatchling reptiles are strongly influenced by incubation regimes (e.g. of temperature and moisture), suggesting that maternal choice of suitable nest-sites should be under intense selection. Our laboratory incubation of 209 eggs (17 clutches) from wild-caught Swedish grass snakes (Natrix natrix) showed that scale abnormalities (half-scales on one side of the body, often reflecting lateral asymmetry in the number of ribs) occurred more frequently if eggs were incubated under cooler conditions. Especially at low incubation temperatures, individuals with scale asymmetries took longer to hatch than did symmetric conspecifics, were smaller in body length at hatching and were slower in trials of locomotor speed. Anti-predator tactics also covaried with scale asymmetry. These patterns suggest that individuals with asymmetric scales should have lower fitness and hence should rarely survive to adulthood in the wild. We tested this prediction by examining 201 field-collected snakes from museum collections. As predicted, scale asymmetries were seen primarily in small snakes, and rarely in larger animals. We interpret these data to suggest that scale asymmetries in this species offer an index of developmental instability and that fitness disadvantages to disrupted embryogenesis impose selection against suboptimal nest-site choice by females.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary theory predicts that when phenotypic variation arises during development that differently influences the fitness of each sex, selection should favor the maternal ability to match offspring phenotype to the sex that incurs a fitness benefit from that phenotype. In reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination, the temperatures experienced during incubation can influence numerous phenotypic parameters, including sex. To mimic more naturalistic conditions, this experiment examined how variation in temperature fluctuations affects offspring sex as well as a suite of phenotypic parameters having putative fitness consequences in the Northern Painted Turtle (Chrysemys picta (Schneider, 1783)). We also characterized variation in natural nest temperatures, including the daily temperature range, related to the vegetation cover surrounding the nest. We found that temperature fluctuations did not affect hatchling morphology, immune response, or behavior, but did significantly affect offspring sex ratios. Thermal profiles of natural nests were related to the amount of surrounding vegetation. Results suggest that nest-site choice by females could influence the sex of their offspring, but we found no evidence that variation in temperature fluctuations adaptively matches offspring sex and phenotype.},

	abstract = {According to the maternal manipulation hypothesis, females manipulate the phenotypes of their offspring by selecting favourable incubation conditions. In oviparous black ratsnakes (Elaphe obsoleta Say in James, 1823), females manipulate offspring phenotype through nest-site selection. This study aimed to determine whether the thermal mean and variance of the incubation regime affect fitness-related traits in hatchlings. We incubated 136 eggs in a split-clutch design at two thermal means (26 and 29 8C) and variances (constant and $\pm$3 8C). Hatchlings incubated at higher temperatures hatched earlier, were longer, faster, and less defensive. Hatchlings incubated at constant temperatures hatched earlier and were longer. For athletic performance, there was a significant interaction between temperature mean and variance: hatchlings incubated at 29 8C swam faster, had a lower muscular strength, and righted themselves equally fast when incubated at constant temperatures, whereas hatchlings incubated at 26 8C were stronger, swam faster, and righted themselves more slowly. Overall, constant incubation temperatures produced hatchlings with phenotypes favouring higher survival than fluctuating temperatures, but the effect of thermal variance was not as pronounced as the effect of thermal mean. Therefore, we found some support for the hypothesis that black ratsnakes prefer communal over single-female nests because communal nests have higher, more constant temperatures. Re´sume´ : L'hypothe`se de la manipulation maternelle veut que les femelles manipulent les phe´notypes de leurs rejetons en choisissant des conditions favorables d'incubation. Chez la couleuvre obscure (Elaphe obsoleta Say in James, 1823) qui est ovipare, les femelles manipulent le phe´notype de leurs rejetons par leur choix du site de nidification. Notre e´tude cherche a` de´terminer si la moyenne et la variance de la tempe´rature du re´gime d'incubation affectent les traits relie´s a` l'aptitude chez les nouveau-ne´s. Nous avons incube´ 136 {\oe}ufs, d'apre`s un plan expe´rimental de couve´es divise´es, a` deux moyennes (26 et 29 8C) et deux variances (tempe´rature constante et $\pm$3 8C) de tempe´rature. Les nouveau-ne´s incube´s aux tempe´ratures plus e´leve´es e´closent plus toˆt, ils sont plus longs, plus rapides et moins de´fensifs. Les nouveau-ne´s incube´s a` des tempe´ratures constantes e´closent plus toˆt et sont plus longs. Il y a une interaction significative entre la moyenne et la variance de tempe´rature en ce qui a trait a` la performance athle´tique : les nouveau-ne´s incube´s a` 29 8C nagent plus vite, posse`dent une force musculaire plus faible et se redressent a` la meˆme vitesse lorsqu'ils sont incube´s a` tempe´rature constante; en contraste, les nouveau-ne´s incube´s a` 26 8C sont plus forts, nagent plus rapidement et se redressent moins vite. Globalement, l'incubation a` tempe´rature constante produit des nouveau-ne´s qui posse`dent des phe´notypes qui favorisent une meilleure survie que l'incubation a` tempe´rature fluctuante; cependant, les effets de la variance de tempe´rature ne sont pas aussi prononce´s que ceux de la moyenne. Nous trouvons donc un certain appui pour l'hypothe`se qui veut que les couleuvres obscures pre´fe`rent les nids communautaires aux nids de femelles solitaires, parce que les nids communautaires ont des tempe´ratures plus e´leve´es et plus constantes.},

@article{putz_embryonic_2006,
	abstract = {Individual differences in the adult sexual behavior of vertebrates are rooted in the fetal environment. In the leopard gecko (Eublepharis macularius), a species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), hatchling sex ratios differ between incubation temperatures, as does sexuality in same-sex animals. This variation can primarily be ascribed to the temperature having direct organizing actions on the brain. Here we demonstrate that embryonic temperature can affect adult mate choice in the leopard gecko. Given the simultaneous choice between two females from different incubation temperatures (30.0 and 34.0C), males from one incubation temperature (30.0C) preferred the female from 34.0C, while males from another incubation temperature (32.5C) preferred the female from 30.0C. We suggest that this difference in mate choice is due to an environmental influence on brain development leading to differential perception of opposite-sex individuals. This previously unrecognized modulator of adult mate choice lends further support to the view that mate choice is best understood in the context of an individual's entire life-history. Thus, sexual selection results from a combination of the female's as well as the male's life history. Female attractiveness and male choice therefore are complementary. {\ss} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Psychobiol 48: 29--38, 2006.},

Tortoises were held at one of three temperatures (19, 28, 37 C) during the four months following hatching, then placed into a control temperature of 28 C. Body mass, maximum plastron width, height, and length ratios were determined monthly for the following year. Nine months post-hatching, cloacal and shell temperatures were determined while animals were allowed to behaviorally regulate their temperature in a thermal gradient ranging from 23-45 C. Animals held at 37 C had a greater surface area-to-volume ratio (flat morphology) than animals maintained at 19 or 28 C (round morphology). These morphological changes were correlated with thermoregulatory behavior. Animals with a greater surface area-to-volume ratio (37 C) had a lower cycle frequency (movement between minimum and maximum temperatures) and higher mean core temperature than 19 and 28 C animals. These experiments indicate the existence of a window during juvenile development in which temperature will influence morphological and behavioral characteristics.},

@article{shine_egg-laying_1999,
	abstract = {Studies on reptilian life-history evolution have emphasized the role of cold climates as a selective force for the evolution of viviparity, but have tended to neglect the many cold-climate reptiles that retain oviparity. Many of these species avoid low incubation temperatures by selecting warm nest-sites, and the evolution of viviparity (by uterine retention and maternal thermoregulation) is an extension of this strategy. However, an alternative pathway exists: reptiles may adapt to low-temperature incubation rather than avoid it. The scincid lizard Nannoscincus maccoyi from high-elevation areas of south-eastern Australia follows this alternative strategy. Field studies show that Nannoscincus selects cooler oviposition sites than does the sympatric heliothermic skink Bassiana duperreyi, owing to differences in the type of cover object (log vs. rock), the size of cover object and the depth to which eggs are buried. These interspeci{\textregistered}c differences in natural incubation regimes are re¯ected in the responses of laboratory-incubated eggs to incubation temperature. Bassiana eggs tolerate higher temperatures than do Nannoscincus eggs, but do not develop as rapidly at low temperatures. Incubation at lower temperatures produces a larger, faster hatchling in Nannoscincus, whereas the reverse is true in Bassiana. Thus, Nannoscincus and Bassiana follow different pathways to overcome the dif{\textregistered}culties of reproducing in cold climates. Only the Bassiana pathway is likely to be compatible with the evolution of viviparity.},

@article{siviter_incubation_2017,
	abstract = {Recent work exploring the relationship between early environmental conditions and cognition has shown that incubation environment can influence both brain anatomy and performance in simple operant tasks in young lizards. It is currently unknown how it impacts other, potentially more sophisticated, cognitive processes. Social-cognitive abilities, such as gaze following and social learning, are thought to be highly adaptive as they provide a short-cut to acquiring new information. Here, we investigated whether egg incubation temperature influenced two aspects of social cognition, gaze following and social learning in adult reptiles (
              Pogona vitticeps
              ). Incubation temperature did not influence the gaze following ability of the bearded dragons; however, lizards incubated at colder temperatures were quicker at learning a social task and faster at completing that task. These results are the first to show that egg incubation temperature influences the social cognitive abilities of an oviparous reptile species and that it does so differentially depending on the task. Further, the results show that the effect of incubation environment was not ephemeral but lasted long into adulthood. It could thus have potential long-term effects on fitness.},

@article{vila_pouca_incubation_2018,
	abstract = {Climate change is warming the world's oceans at an unprecedented rate. Under predicted end-of-century temperatures, many teleosts show impaired development and altered critical behaviors, including behavioral lateralisation. Since laterality is an expression of brain functional asymmetries, changes in the strength and direction of lateralisation suggest that rapid climate warming might impact brain development and function. However, despite the implications for cognitive functions, the potential effects of elevated temperature in lateralisation of elasmobranch fishes are unknown. We incubated and reared Port Jackson sharks at current and projected end-of-century temperatures and measured preferential detour responses to left or right. Sharks incubated at elevated temperature showed stronger absolute laterality and were significantly biased towards the right relative to sharks reared at current temperature. We propose that animals reared under elevated temperatures might have more strongly lateralized brains to cope with deleterious effects of climate change on brain development and growth. However, far more research in elasmobranch lateralisation is needed before the significance of these results can be fully comprehended. This study provides further evidence that elasmobranchs are susceptible to the effects of future ocean warming, though behavioral mechanisms might allow animals to compensate for some of the challenges imposed by climate change.},

The mortality rate of sharks reared in warm water was 41.7\% compared with no mortality in the present-day sharks. Contrary to expectations, our results suggest that surviving hatchlings from the elevated-temperature group took fewer days to reach learning criterion and had a higher proportion of correct choice compared with hatchlings reared under present conditions. Additionally, this is the first data suggesting that sharks can discriminate different quantities. Our results seem to indicate that learning and behaviour might play a role in allowing elasmobranchs to overcome some of the deleterious effects of climate warming, but further research is needed to fully comprehend these findings.},

@article{burger_effects_1991,
	abstract = {Incubation temperatures in vertebrates affect incubation periods, and in some reptiles incubation temperature determines sex ratios and some limited behavior. Here I present evidence that incubation temperature in pine snakes (Pituophis melanoleucus) affects not only incubation periods and posthatching behavior in the laboratory, but also the behavior of hatchlings required for successful emergence and survival. These behavioral differences have evolutionary implications for selection of hatchlings from particular temperature nests. With increasing temperature, incubation periods decreased in the laboratory. In addition, incubation temperature affected hatching and emergence times as well as movement speed and foraging ability. Hatchlings from medium temperature conditions emerged from nests in the field in less time than hatchlings incubated at high or low temperatures, and hatchlings from low temperatures moved slower and were less able to capture and eat mice in the laboratory than hatchlings incubated at medium or high temperatures. Taken together, these laboratory and field experiments suggest that hatchlings from low temperature nests, compared to those from higher temperature nests, would be less able to emerge, find food, and locate hibernation sites prior to the onset of cold temperatures in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. These results suggest that incubation temperature affects a whole range of behavior and that distributional ranges of reptiles and other poikilotherms could be affected by summer temperatures (via incubation period and subsequent behavior) as well as ambient winter temperatures.},

@article{dayananda_incubation_2017,
	abstract = {Despite compelling evidence for substantial individual differences in cognitive performance, it is unclear whether cognitive ability influences fitness of wild animals. In many animals, environmental stressors experienced
              in utero
              can produce substantial variation in the cognitive abilities of offspring. In reptiles, incubation temperatures experienced by embryos can influence hatchling brain function and learning ability. Under climate warming, the eggs of some lizard species may experience higher temperatures, which could affect the cognitive abilities of hatchlings. Whether such changes in cognitive abilities influence the survival of hatchlings is unknown. To determine whether incubation-induced changes in spatial learning ability affect hatchling survival, we incubated velvet gecko,
              Amalosia lesueurii
              , eggs using two fluctuating temperature regimes to mimic current (cold) versus future (hot) nest temperatures. We measured the spatial learning ability of hatchlings from each treatment, and released individually marked animals at two field sites in southeastern Australia. Hatchlings from hot-incubated eggs were slower learners than hatchlings from cold-incubated eggs. Survival analyses revealed that hatchlings with higher learning scores had higher survival than hatchlings with poor learning scores. Our results show that incubation temperature affects spatial learning ability in hatchling lizards, and that such changes can influence the survival of hatchlings in the wild.},
